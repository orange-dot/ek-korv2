TC397XP Emulator - JEZGRO Firmware Boot Log
============================================
Date: 2026-01-20
Firmware: jezgro-tricore.elf
Emulator: tcpxxx-emu (commit: see git log)

=== Execution Summary ===
  Instructions:  1,000,000
  Cycles:        12,293,552
  Final PC:      0x8000560A (idle loop)
  Final State:   RUNNING

=== Boot Sequence ===
1. ELF loaded with toolchain bug workarounds
2. crt0 startup assembly executed
3. CSA initialization (128 entries)
4. .data/.bss initialization complete
5. C startup (_startup_tc397xp) called
6. Idle loop entered - calling __nop repeatedly

=== CSA Configuration ===
  Region: 0x70033D40
  Entries: 128 (8KB total)
  FCX/LCX: Properly initialized
  Link format: bits[19:16]=segment, bits[15:0]=offset/64

=== Notes ===
- Single core (CPU0) active
- Timing annotations present but NOT validated
- Peripheral stubs (STM, ASCLIN) not exercised in this run

=== Verification ===
This log demonstrates functional instruction execution.
It does NOT validate:
- Cycle timing accuracy
- Peripheral behavior
- Multi-core operation
