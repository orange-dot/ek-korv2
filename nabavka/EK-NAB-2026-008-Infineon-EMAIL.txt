Subject: RFQ EK-NAB-2026-008 - XMC4400 / AURIX TC397 / Gate Drivers

Dear Infineon Team,

We are developing modular EV charging infrastructure for electric bus fleets, built around Infineon components.

Our architecture:
- EK3 module (3.3kW): XMC4400 for LLC control (HRPWM)
- Charger level: TC397 for ROJ coordination (multi-module, multi-charger)
- Software: JEZGRO - custom microkernel RTOS, portable across Cortex-M4 and TriCore

Current status:
- JEZGRO running on STM32G474 (Renode) and TC397XP (custom emulator)
- XMC4400 port planned (same Cortex-M4 core)
- Hardware needed to validate against real silicon

Please find attached our RFQ covering:
- XMC4400 / XMC4700 development kits and MCUs
- AURIX TC397 TriBoard and MCUs
- TLE9251V CAN-FD transceivers
- EiceDRIVER gate drivers for SiC MOSFETs
- Power management and current sensing ICs

We would appreciate pricing and lead time information.

Best regards,
