## Lowercarbon Investment Thesis

### Iz njihovog website-a i intervjua:

```
"We back the world's most ambitious and scalable
 decarbonization solutions"

FOCUS AREAS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
✓ Energy (generation, storage, grid)
✓ Transportation (EV, logistics, aviation)
✓ Industrial materials (steel, cement, chemicals)
✓ Carbon removal (DAC, nature-based)
✓ Advanced manufacturing

EV INFRASTRUCTURE = SQUARELY IN THESIS
```

### Sacca's Style:

1. **"Unfuck the planet"** - direktan, bez BS-a
2. **Scalable solutions** - ne niche, već planetary impact
3. **Founder-first** - voli contrarian founders
4. **Technical depth** - razume tehnologiju
5. **Speed** - brze odluke, ne vole duge procese

## Kako Pozicionirati Elektrokombinaciju

### Lowercarbon voli:

```
CLIMATE IMPACT FRAME:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. UPTIME = MORE ELECTRIC MILES
   - Svaki % downtime = dizel backup
   - 95% uptime vs 70% = masivna CO2 razlika
   - "Reliability is a climate metric"

2. SCALABILITY STORY
   - Modular = proizvodnja u volumenu
   - Jedan dizajn za sve veličine (3kW-3MW)
   - "Tesla approach to charging infrastructure"

3. GRID FLEXIBILITY
   - V2G ready arhitektura
   - Peak shaving capability
   - "Chargers as grid assets"

4. EMERGING MARKET POTENTIAL
   - Jeftino održavanje = deployment svuda
   - Afrika, Indija, SEA - ne samo EU/US
   - "Climate solutions for the whole planet"
```

## Tailored Messaging

### NEMOJ reći → RECI ovako:

| Generički | Lowercarbon-optimizovano |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| "Manji downtime" | "More electric miles, less diesel backup" |
| "Jeftinije održavanje" | "Scales to emerging markets" |
| "Robot zamena" | "Unfair advantage: 40-second repair" |
| "Modularno" | "Manufacturing scalability like Tesla" |
| "Patenti" | "Defensible moat in critical infrastructure" |
| "EU tržište" | "Starting EU, then global deployment" |

Subject: 40-Second Charger Repair - EV Fleet Infrastructure

Hey Lowercarbon team,

Every time an EV bus charger fails, a diesel backup runs.
Current fleet charger uptime: 70-85%. That's a lot of diesel.

We're fixing this with robotic module swapping:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Modular "blade server" architecture
• Robot swaps failed unit in 40 seconds
• No truck rolls, no technician visits
• Target: 95%+ uptime

THE UNFAIR ADVANTAGE:
While competitors send service trucks, we send a robot arm.
Same repair that takes them 4 hours takes us 40 seconds.
5 patent concepts locked with WIPO PROOF (Jan 2026).

WHY THIS SCALES:
Single 3kW module design scales from 3kW to 3MW.
Manufacturing simplicity = cost reduction at volume.
Low maintenance = deployable in emerging markets.

TRACTION:
• Patent portfolio secured
• Technical architecture validated
• Targeting EU transit operators for first pilot

ASK:
$1.5M seed for prototype and first pilot deployment.
15-min call to show you why this unfucks charger maintenance.

## One-Pager: Climate Impact Version

```
ELEKTROKOMBINACIJA
Reliable EV Charging for Planetary Scale
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE CLIMATE PROBLEM
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Fleet charger downtime forces diesel backup usage.
Current EV charger uptime: 70-85%
Every failure = emissions. Every hour down = diesel running.

THE SOLUTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━
Robotic self-repair for EV charging infrastructure.

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  TRADITIONAL           vs        ELEKTROKOMBINACIJA         │
│  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  │
│  Monolithic charger              Modular blade architecture │
│  Failure → entire unit down      Failure → one module       │
│  Wait for truck (hours/days)     Robot swap (40 seconds)    │
│  70-85% uptime                   95%+ uptime                │
│  Diesel backup runs              Electric keeps running     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

SCALABILITY
━━━━━━━━━━━
• One module design: 3kW unit
• Scales: 3kW → 3MW (stack more modules)
• Manufacturing: Volume production of identical units
• Maintenance: Zero specialized technicians needed
• Global: Works in Berlin AND Nairobi

CLIMATE MATH
━━━━━━━━━━━━
100 buses × 20% downtime improvement × 300 days/year
= 6,000 additional electric operating days per fleet
= ~900 tons CO2 avoided per fleet per year

Multiply by 50,000+ bus fleets globally = gigatons of impact.

THE MOAT
━━━━━━━━
5 patent concepts with priority date (WIPO PROOF Jan 2026):
• EK-2026-001: Unified Modular Power Architecture
• EK-2026-002: Dual-Purpose Robotic Swap Station
• EK-2026-003: Distributed Power Sparing System
• EK-2026-004: Fleet-Integrated Maintenance Logistics
• EK-2026-005: Coordinated Dual-Robot System

MARKET
━━━━━━
TAM: $100B+ (Global EV bus charging infrastructure)
WHY NOW: EU 2035 mandate + fleet electrification wave

THE ASK
━━━━━━━
$1.5M seed
• Prototype: $600K
• First pilot: $400K
• Team: $300K
• IP/Legal: $200K

Timeline: Working pilot in 12 months

## X/Twitter Outreach

### Sacca je aktivan na X - može reagovati na dobar post:

```
Tweet 1 (standalone):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Every time an EV bus charger fails, a diesel backup starts.

Current fleet charger uptime: 70-85%

We're building robotic self-repair for chargers.
40-second module swap. 95%+ uptime.

More uptime = more electric miles = less diesel.

@sacca @laboradowercarbon this is the unsexy climate infra
that actually moves the needle.

---

Tweet 2 (reply/thread):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The insight: chargers don't need to be monolithic.

Blade server architecture for EV charging:
- Modular 3kW units
- Hot-swappable
- Robot replacement

Same manufacturing revolution that happened in datacenters,
now coming to energy infrastructure.
```

## Follow-up Strategy

```
DAY 1: Send pitch@lowercarbon.com email
DAY 3: Post on X, tag @sacca and @lowercarbon
DAY 7: Follow-up email if no response
DAY 14: LinkedIn outreach to team members
DAY 21: Second follow-up or move on

PARALLEL:
- Look for warm intros via climate tech network
- Check if they have office hours or events
```

---

## Fit Assessment

```
PROS:
✓ EV infrastructure is CORE thesis
✓ Climate impact story is clear
✓ Scalability angle resonates
✓ Technical moat (patents)
✓ They move fast

CONS:
- Competitive deal flow (many pitches)
- May want US traction first
- Hardware = longer timeline than software

VERDICT: HIGH PRIORITY
This is one of the best fits on the list.
Worth significant effort to get in front of them.
