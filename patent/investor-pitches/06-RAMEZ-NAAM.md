## Kako Pozicionirati Elektrokombinaciju

### Ramez Frame: GRID + SYSTEMS + DATA

```
RAMEZ RESONANCE POINTS:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. GRID RELIABILITY ANGLE
   "Fleet chargers are grid assets in disguise"
   - V2G ready architecture
   - Peak shaving capability
   - Flexible load = grid value

2. WRIGHT'S LAW FOR MODULES
   - Manufacturing cost curves
   - Volume production economics
   - "Learning rate" za power modules

3. SYSTEMS INTERCONNECTION
   - Charger + bus + grid + robot = system
   - Fleet logistics doubles as spare parts logistics
   - Self-healing = grid reliability

4. DATA STORY
   - Sensor data from every module
   - Continuous monitoring: early detection OR instant response
   - Grid services optimization

5. ENERGY TRANSITION ENABLER
   - Reliability enables electrification
   - More uptime = more electric miles
```

## Tailored Messaging

### NEMOJ reći → RECI ovako:

| Generički | Ramez-optimizovano |
|-----------|-------------------|
| "Bolji punjač" | "Grid asset with reliability innovation" |
| "Modularno" | "Wright's Law economics - learning curve" |
| "Patenti" | "System innovation, not just component" |
| "Fleet" | "Interconnected system (vehicles + infra + grid)" |
| "Downtime" | "Grid reliability metric" |

## X/Twitter DM

### Ramez odgovara na DM - best approach:

DM Template:
━━━━━━━━━━━━
Hi Ramez,

Been following your grid analysis work. Quick question on
something I'm building:

We're making modular EV chargers with robotic hot-swap.
Module fails → robot swaps in 40 sec → zero downtime.

The systems insight: fleet buses transport replacement
modules as part of normal routes. Spare parts logistics
rides on existing fleet logistics.

The grid angle: V2G-ready architecture means these become
flexible grid assets, not just chargers.

Would value your perspective on the grid integration side.
5-10 min call? Happy to share technical docs.

## Tweet Engagement Strategy

```
APPROACH:
━━━━━━━━
1. Engage with his energy/grid tweets genuinely
2. Add value in replies (data, insights)
3. Eventually post own content on EV charging
4. Tag him on grid-related aspects

---

REPLY TO HIS CONTENT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
When he posts about grid/EVs, reply with insight:

"This ties to something I'm seeing in fleet charging:
reliability is the hidden bottleneck. 15-30% downtime
on chargers means grid flexibility goes unused.
Working on fixing the reliability layer first."

---

OWN TWEET (tag him):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The hidden grid asset: reliable EV fleet chargers.

V2G potential is massive. But current charger uptime
is 70-85%. Can't do grid services if charger is broken.

Building modular architecture with robotic self-repair.
Step 1: reliability. Step 2: grid services.

@ramez curious on your grid integration perspective
```

THE SYSTEMS VIEW
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
EV chargers aren't just chargers. They're grid assets.

But current chargers have 15-30% downtime.
Can't provide grid services if you're broken.
Reliability is the foundation for grid integration.

WRIGHT'S LAW ECONOMICS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Single module design (3kW EK3)
Volume production → cost learning curve
Same module in 3kW bike charger and 3MW depot

Manufacturing learning rate applies across ALL deployments.

GRID SERVICES POTENTIAL
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
With 95%+ uptime (vs current 70-85%):
• V2G participation → revenue
• Peak shaving → grid value
• Frequency regulation → ancillary services
• Demand response → utility payments

Current chargers leave this money on the table
because they're too unreliable.

THE DATA LAYER
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Every module generates:
• Power quality data
• Thermal profiles
• Efficiency metrics
• Degradation curves

→ Continuous monitoring: early detection (days) OR instant response (minutes)
→ Grid optimization (which modules for which services)
→ Fleet coordination (logistics + charging optimization)

## Fit Assessment

```
PROS:
✓ Deep grid/energy understanding
✓ Accessible via X DM
✓ Systems thinker
✓ Can provide signal to larger investors
✓ Writing/speaking platform

CONS:
- Smaller check size ($25K-100K)
- May not have capacity for many deals
- Advisory more than lead investor

VERDICT: HIGH PRIORITY for different reason
Small check but high signal value.
His endorsement opens doors.
Great advisor potential.
```

---

## The Ask

```
Two possible asks:

1. INVESTMENT
   $50K angel check as part of larger round
   + Advisory role

2. ADVISORY ONLY
   Regular calls on grid strategy
   Introductions to energy investors
   Public endorsement when ready

Either is valuable. Be flexible.
