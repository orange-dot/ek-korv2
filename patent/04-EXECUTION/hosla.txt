What We Work On
We take on the challenge of rethinking the familiar.

Ventures we back have one or more of these critical elements:
A significant innovation in either (or both) technology or business model.

Unusual approaches to technology, ventures into new markets, or contrarian approaches to existing markets.

“Black swan” ideas (high-impact innovations beyond the norm). As Nassim Nicholas Taleb put it, black swans are characterized by rarity, extreme impact and retrospective predictability. High-impact investments can change the dynamics of large markets.

We also pay close attention to ventures that aren’t intimidated by large markets — either current ones, or those newly enabled (or disrupted) by innovation. We love products that can break monopolies or create whole new markets. Similarly, we are keen to find a billion dollar market (versus a million dollar market) with a credible path to growth.

Another desirable quality: a venture with short innovation cycles. We look for rapid cycles that lead to proof points and results, good or bad. (But we may also break our own rule: we have invested in a nuclear reactor with a long innovation cycle because other factors were compelling.)

‍

About risk-taking:
Not all hard things are valuable, but most valuable things are hard. Every plan has risks, and we both understand and cherish that. We prefer technology risk to market risk, and we prefer to remove technology and business risks up front. Clearly identified and understood risks, along with a cogent plan for removing them for the least amount of money, are important criteria for evaluating ventures. It is more advantageous to all parties to fail in six months on $75,000 than in six years and $75M. We want to focus on the key risks early.

If you are considering KV:
Our fundamental business is technology-based economic disruption of large markets.

We prefer bold bets, though we make many types of bets. We bet on exceptional entrepreneurs, though we recognize this is a very qualitative and difficult assessment to make. We shun the smaller bet for the bigger bet, so we are a fit if you want to build a big, ambitious company. If you’re seeking a quick sale, there are other, better investment partners for you.

We are not looking for good ROI; we are looking to build companies. In our view, ROI follows company building. We will help you redefine your plan to meet these criteria if the technology breakthroughs are significant. We are good matches for teams that want assistance in building a bigger company, and we have a large range of operating resources to offer.

If you have a compelling technology-based story, if you are exceptionally accomplished or credentialed, if you are passionate and burning with creative fire, we are willing to listen.

For more on what we work on, take the time to understand our past efforts, our inspirations and how we think about inventing the future.

What we don’t invest in:
Growth capital / project financing / real estate / small business
We understand that there are: successful small businesses looking to expand their operations but lack differentiated technology or business-model innovations; project owners, operators and developers who are looking to build a plant, manufacturing facility or energy farm. While these are all worthwhile ideas, they are primarily the purview of financial service providers. This is not our focus at KV.

Niche markets with low upside but good IRR
At KV, we’re looking for ventures that have the growth potential to be billion-dollar companies. There is a significant difference between a million-dollar market and a billion-dollar market. A good return on investment (ROI) is not enough of an incentive for us. We care about pursuing good ROI in large companies.

Public companies conducting equity raises
Our goal and commitment is to invest in companies that aim to become large, sustainable public businesses. Businesses that are already public generally do not fit this criterion.

Copycat business plans
If your business plan is built on copying what existing companies are already doing (without a significant innovation), you are unlikely to be a fit for us. A social networking proposal that promises to be “just like Facebook” is not a compelling idea.

How We Work
We are in the company-building business, not the “deal” or “capital” business.
We love working together with entrepreneurs to turn something good into something great. Our history is one of leveraging our relationships to grow teams, attracting partners and customers, and then — together with founders — we build billion-dollar businesses. We are active partners who do everything we can for our companies. We haven’t forgotten how to hustle or get into the trenches with our companies at every stage. We are patient investors and strive to work together to build enduring companies that stand the test of time.

Our strategic advice and creative ideas help you think outside the box. We can guide you in changing the rules or assess when “good” isn’t good enough. We ask you, and ourselves, hard questions: Are we working to protect against the worst scenario? Are we leveraging the upside? Are we planning for assets as well as liabilities? Every business goes through pivotal moments: caving on a term or losing a customer, canceling a product line or keeping it in market, erring on a key hiring decision. We have made most of these mistakes before. Now we can help you find someone in our portfolio to help you think through next steps.

Our style is very direct and straightforward. We are not here to be your friends or to control ownership; we are all about helping you build a business. We prefer brutal honesty to hypocritical politeness. You won’t have to guess what we’re thinking; even if we have a hard conversation, it’s because we think it helps you as an entrepreneur.

We can have strong opinions, and will challenge you without confronting you. (If you’re uncomfortable with this approach, we’re probably not a fit.) Once we pick a management team, we back it and don’t second-guess it. In our board roles, we seldom vote against a management team. Instead, we are here to challenge your team to think ahead, think bigger, and consider impending pitfalls.

How We Decide
Founders and changemakers have a few things in common no matter which industry they want to reinvent: unstoppable passion; a singular commitment to achieving their vision; and an unreasonable mindset.
To find the right investors, board members and partners, it’s critical for founders to acknowledge and be transparent with their goals, whether it’s to go for a bigger play or stay more conservative, turn a quick sale or build a long-lasting company. The right advisors are people who can be both your biggest cheerleaders and your toughest critics, and who won’t shy away from hard conversations. They ask the questions you never knew were important. They serve as guides, helping you navigate the difficult road of building a company from the ground up, spotting things that an entrepreneur might otherwise miss (risks and opportunities alike).

We look for A teams and founders: entrepreneurs who know what they know, and are the best in the world at it — but are also aware of what they don’t know, and are open to building strong teams to fill those knowledge gaps. Experience in the domain in which they want to innovate is not a requirement. We invest more in people than in a specific plan, because plans often change.

We differentiate our investments between two funds. Our Seed Fund supports science or business innovation experiments where we often are the sole investor, but may also partner with angel investors or smaller funds. At the seed stage, we’re looking for a crazy idea, one that may require upending an established business model or even an industry — and may have a significant chance of working. We don’t need to see a full team or even complete plans; we need to understand the key technology risks of your approach, and the economic and market benefits if it is successful.

From a seed perspective, planning for risk elimination at the lowest possible cost is the key variable. Your seed plan should validate your hunch about the market and help you to decide which segment you want to enter, refine an entry strategy, or remove a key technical risk.

Our Main Fund supports more traditional ventures from early to later stages in all areas of technology, including all financings that exceed $10M in total round size. We are looking for billion-dollar markets and differentiated approaches. For Main Fund consideration, we assume that a reasonable number of the risks and milestones (or uncertain markets) associated with seed-type investments have been mitigated, though we understand there is still significant technology and execution risk.

While our focus is on the capabilities of the underlying technology or business model as well as winning in large markets, we want to understand what risks remain, and what you’re doing to mitigate them, as well as your go-to-market approach. Markets, financials and a critical mass of teams become more important for the Main Fund, though we still accept gaps in the complete picture and business plan.

But clear identification of the key success variables and missing pieces is important. What are you looking for from KV? Why have you sought out us specifically? It will be important to provide a clear statement of the milestones you’ll achieve with financing, your future cash needs to break even, or an explanation of another determinable milestone. The thoroughness and quality of the team’s thinking is also important: with some exceptions, the goal is to execute rather than to explore markets or technologies.

Seed Fund
Problem Overview
What is the problem you are trying to solve?

Seed is about defining the characteristics of very large opportunities. We will take large risks. Seed is about setting up your founder capacity to build a large business and to identify your risks. It is not about money…we will set the foundation if right.

Unfair Advantage
Do you have a scientific breakthrough, intellectual property, business-model innovation or a unique partnership? Why is now the right time? If your plan is successful, what economic or market benefit will the technology convey?

Address your innovation in significant detail: Think in terms of science and engineering or business model innovation. Explain the principles of the technology. What, if anything, has been proven? How far is this from commercial scalability? What risks remain to be proven? What are the three major things that could go wrong? Have theoretical models been created or validated? What external third party has validated your models and experimental results? How long will it take to validate the viability of the technology, through experiments or otherwise?

The quality of the team’s thinking is important but at this early stage, not its thoroughness. The general goal, with some exceptions, is to explore markets or technologies, validate assumptions or hunches, identify roles and build the core team correctly. It's about engineering the gene pool of your company.

Founder and Team
Who are you as a founder, and why are you qualified to lead this opportunity? What skills or approach do you bring to this problem? What technical skills will your team need to add? Do you envision yourself as the long-term CEO or in another role? The focus is mostly on you, your goals and your technical team. Why are you uniquely qualified to solve this problem? Are the founders thought leaders or associated with thought leaders in the field?

People, who are key to your innovation, matter to us. What is the role of every member of your current team? Are they all working toward mitigating your primary risks, or are they working on non-critical development that can be addressed later? Are they the best possible people for meeting your current milestones? Which critical people who could address your key risks are missing, and where can you find them?

Risk Reduction Milestones/Financials
It’s important to understand your path to mitigating the risks you face. What risk reduction milestones will this financing help achieve? What are your future milestones, and how much capital will you need to achieve each? What is the company status and burn rate at each of these milestones? What are your contingency plans if things don’t go well? Is the amount you’re seeking in line with the risk-removal milestones you’ve outlined? What is your total and operating cash burn (the amount you’re spending) per month, in case months stretch into years?

Market/Competition
Do you have a good understanding of your competitive landscape? Are you comparing your company against technology competition in areas that matter to the end customer? Are you comparing your future product to your competitor’s current product or to their future product? Is your innovation addressing a need in a large enough market (over a billion dollars)?

How significant a step forward is represented by technology or innovation? What impact will it have on the competition? Why can’t a competitor replicate your plan tomorrow? Why have other players in the field missed out on the innovation?

What Doesn't Matter:
Seed Fund
“We project $xM revenue in five years.”
Your five-year marketing financials and revenue projections are a shot in the dark. All forecasts are wrong (including ours). Instead, focus on your burn rate and your path toward achieving risk reduction milestones at the lowest cash consumption rather than false precision at this stage.

‍

“We expect to grow from 50M to 150M users in x-time frame.”
We’re more interested in how you acquire and keep your initial customers. Plans often fail to explain how the founders will bootstrap themselves in startup mode. How will you get to a target customer base in the first few months or quarters? Details matter more than broad, unsupported assumptions or claims. If you have indicators or solutions to the bootstrapping risk, that is important to us.

‍

“I have the next Facebook / Google / Airbnb.”
If your business plan is built on copying what existing companies are already doing, you are unlikely to succeed. Instead, explain to us why you are the first in your field. We are skeptical if your idea is “a better social network than Facebook”. Building another “me too” product with slightly better features is seldom our cup of tea.

‍

“I have a complete business plan. I just need funds to make it happen.”
If you are looking solely for funds as opposed to help in building a business, we are probably not your best seed fund option. It is important to us to understand what help you need and how open you are to this help.

Main Fund
Problem Overview
Try to define the company’s purpose in one clear sentence. What is the problem you’re trying to solve? What pain point are you alleviating for your customer, and why would they pick you? What are their alternatives, and what is the status quo? From a customer perspective, is the value proposition jaw-dropping, and do you have customer referrals to prove it?

At this moment, what is the status of the underlying technology? How much further does technological innovation need to scale to meet commercial standards? What is the margin of error if the technology is underperforming — or exceeding the expected cost targets? What needs to be achieved to make your value proposition compelling?

Team
Who are you, and why are you qualified to lead this opportunity? Are you the long-term CEO of your company? What skill sets do you bring, and what skills will your team need to add? What parts of your executive team still require filling out? What are the team’s relationships with thought leaders in the field?

What is the company “gene pool” like, and where are the gaps? For each gap, who would be the ideal hire to solve the risk, and where will you find this person?

Milestones/Financials
It’s vital to develop your financial projections, profit and loss statement, balance sheet and cap table. Accuracy is more important than precision. Contingency planning on the financials is even more critical. What happens to your financial needs if technology or market development slips, or costs are too high?

What are the milestones this financing will achieve? How far are you from being cash flow positive, in terms of both time and money? How many future rounds of financing do you project? What would make your company run out of cash, and what does the worst-case scenario look like in terms of cash flow? For revenue-generating companies, what is your sensitivity to lower-than-expected revenue? Has your revenue ramp been tested? We like to see quarterly financials for the next eight quarters and annual financials beyond that.

Market/Competition
We don’t like sizing the market based on analyst reports because models cannot accurately predict disruptions. Often, a market covered by an analyst is too late for venture. Instead, we prefer a bottom-up sizing of markets based on reasonable assumptions.

Your market size should be the maximum revenue for your business, not the entire supply chain. Don’t confuse the addressable market with industry size. Is your business addressing a need in a large enough market ($1B-plus)? Or if, as is often the case, you are addressing a subset of the market, what is its size, and why will you be competitive in that segment? What opens up that segment to you? We appreciate detailed understanding of the nuances of the market.

Do you have a good understanding of the competitive landscape? Are you comparing your company against the competition in areas that matter to the end customer? Who are 10 ideal customers who will make your company successful, and what are you doing to obtain them? What are the threats that could make the market opportunity obsolete? How does your solution fit into the existing ecosystem, current standards and incentives?

What customers or users do you have? How have you retained them? How will you increase their number exponentially and continue to retain them?

What is your go-to-market strategy? Have you identified the right partnerships? Does your price point justify the cost of sale? Why will consumers use your product over its competitors? What keeps you awake at night? Do you understand your risks? Are they clearly defined, and do you address them in your marketing or technology strategy? The quality of your assessment of market risk helps us judge how well you understand your market.

What Doesn't Matter:
Main Fund
“My company is a ripe acquisition target.”
An acquisition is a reasonable outcome but a horrendous plan. We invest in entrepreneurs who want to build long-lasting, highly profitable public companies.

‍

“Government subsidies will help me win.”
Subsidies bring cash flow forward but seldom create your market or build your business. To succeed, your product must be price competitive without subsidies.

‍

“I have the North American license for XYZ.”
Proprietary technology or a license for such technology is a good thing, but it is not enough on its own. We want you to be the sole owner of the underlying ability to develop new technology. We invest in companies that plan to build significant technology development expertise in-house, so they can stay at the cutting edge and respond to dynamic markets and competition.

Opportunity Fund
For the Opportunity Fund, we are looking for category-defining companies that are ready to scale. These companies may be new to KV or in our existing portfolio.
At this stage, we assume that you have already hit the milestones outlined in our Seed and Main funds. Technology risk has been mitigated through a substantially proven and sustainably differentiated approach. Scalable business economics, including in terms of profitable customer adoption, is established. You have a strong team in place that has a track record of building large businesses. At this stage, you are looking at scaling operations globally to gain maximum market share and reach profitability. This is likely one of the last venture rounds you will take.

Opportunity Overview
What is the long-term vision for the company? What is the key problem you are trying to solve or new market solution you’ve successfully created?

Sustainable Advantage
Has your technology proven that you have an unfair advantage in the market with a history of customer execution? Are there iterations of this technology that allow you to enter new markets? Are there safeguards against the patents for this technology?

Team
Is the team you have the strongest in your industry that will allow you to scale the company? Are you the long-term CEO of this company as it gets closer to an IPO? What are skill sets that might be missing on the current team? How strong is the team in recruiting and retaining key talent? How robust are the team’s relationships with customers, partners and influencers in your industry?

Milestones/Financials
At this stage, we take a very detailed view on your financials and look at areas like customer acquisition costs - both today and how they are likely to scale, manufacturing costs and unit economics over several years. We like to see quarterly financials for the next eight quarters and annual financials beyond that.

Given the rocky nature of markets and slips in product timelines, we ask about contingency planning on these financials and if you have sufficient runway. Also, will this financing get you to cash flow positive and by when?

Market/Competition
At this stage, we believe you have a very strong idea of how large your addressable market is today and what it can be 2-3 years down the road. Don’t confuse addressable markets with industry size. Is your business addressing a subset of the market and if so, why will you be competitive in that segment. What will open up additional segments for you? We like to understand the nuances of your market.

We believe you know who your existing competitors are and the ways you can gain market share from them. What are the ways you believe you can continue to win in your segment? Who are the new competitors as you expand into new segments? What are the threats that could make the market opportunity obsolete? Who are you not thinking of that could disrupt your business entirely?

What Doesn't Matter:
Opportunity Fund
“My company is a copycat of XYZ”
If your plan is built on copying, we are probably not the right fit for you. We seek out bold companies that will be impactful to society. If your pitch is “we are just like Airbnb” in the hotel space, we are not interested.

‍

“My company is an acquisition candidate after this financing”
An acquisition may be a reasonable outcome but if that’s the goal, we’re also not the right fit. We invest in entrepreneurs who want to build category-defining businesses that aim to become profitable and public.

‍

“Government Subsidies will help me win”
While subsidies bring cash flow, they seldom create markets or build your business. At this stage, you should have minimal reliance on them and your product must be competitive without subsidies.
