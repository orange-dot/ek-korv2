## Application Email

**Subject:** Open-Source EV Fleet Coordination + EUR 487K Pre-Seed for 150kW Pilot

---

**Email Body:**

Dear InnoEnergy Investment Team,

I'm applying for seed funding for Elektrokombinacija - combining open-source coordination technology (EK-KOR2) with modular EV charging hardware (EK3) for European electric bus fleets.

**Why Open-Source Matters for EU Energy Infrastructure:**

European energy infrastructure shouldn't depend on proprietary US or Asian coordination systems. We're building EK-KOR2 - an open-source RTOS for distributed energy coordination - developed in Europe (Serbia), to be released under MIT license, creating a foundation for European digital sovereignty in energy.

This aligns directly with:
- EU Open Source Software Strategy (ongoing policy direction toward OSS in public infrastructure)
- GAIA-X open infrastructure initiative
- Horizon Europe Cluster 5 open-source priorities

**The Technical Breakthrough:**

EK-KOR2 uses potential field scheduling - no central coordinator. Modules self-organize like biological swarms. When paired with our EK3 hardware (3.3kW modules), this creates self-healing charging infrastructure:

```
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  EK3 MODULES + EK-KOR2 COORDINATION                         |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
|  [3kW] [3kW] [3kW] [-X-] [3kW] [3kW]  <- Module fails       |
|           |                                                 |
|           +--- EK-KOR2 detects, redistributes load          |
|           +--- Robot swaps failed module (40 sec)           |
|           +--- NO central controller needed                 |
+-------------------------------------------------------------+
```

**InnoEnergy Thesis Fit:**
- **Transport & Mobility**: Direct fleet electrification enabler
- **Smart Grids**: V2G-ready, open-source coordination
- **Circular Economy**: Modular repair, OSS community maintenance
- **EU Strategic**: Open-source digital sovereignty for energy

**Technical Status:**
- EK-KOR2: Working C implementation, 22 test vectors passing
- EK3: Complete 3.3kW module design (900V SiC, LLC topology)
- 5 patent concepts on hardware (WIPO PROOF Jan 2026)
- EK-KOR2 ready for open-source release upon funding (MIT License)

**The Ask:**

EUR 487K pre-seed for:
- Team (12 months, EU-competitive): Founder/CTO, CEO, Electrical Engineer, Operations Manager, External advisors
- EK-KOR2 open-source launch (docs, CI/CD, community)
- EK3 hardware prototype (46 modules = 150kW pilot)
- EU transit operator pilot deployment
- CE certification

**Why InnoEnergy:**

Beyond capital, we seek your network of:
- European transit operators for pilot sites
- EU policy expertise for open-source strategy
- Horizon Europe/CEF funding pathways
- European embedded systems talent

Your track record with hardware startups and commitment to European energy sovereignty makes you the ideal partner for building the open-source foundation of EU charging infrastructure.

**EU Incorporation:**
We are incorporating Elektrokombinacija B.V. in the Netherlands within the next 60 days, establishing our EU headquarters. R&D operations will continue in Serbia (cost-effective engineering), with commercial and IP activities in Netherlands.

## InnoEnergy OSS Conversation Prep

### Expected Questions:

1. **"How do you make money if the software is open-source?"**
   -> "Same model as Red Hat: open-source foundation, monetize hardware
      and services. EK-KOR2 is free. EK3 certified modules are not.
      Plus professional deployment services."

2. **"Why open-source instead of proprietary?"**
   -> "Strategic choice. Open-source creates:
      - Network effects (community adoption)
      - European talent attraction
      - Standard creation moat
      - Alignment with EU digital sovereignty goals
      Proprietary would limit us to one vendor, OSS makes us the standard."

3. **"How does this align with EU strategy?"**
   -> "Directly. EU policy direction favors open-source in critical
      infrastructure. GAIA-X wants open European digital foundation.
      Horizon Europe Cluster 5 prioritizes open-source for energy.
      EK-KOR2 fits all three."

4. **"Why Serbia instead of EU country?"**
   -> "We're incorporating in Netherlands within 60 days - Elektrokombinacija B.V.
      will be the EU headquarters for commercial and IP activities. Serbia
      remains our R&D center - cost-effective engineering, strong talent,
      EU candidate country. Best of both: EU legal structure + Eastern European
      engineering costs."

5. **"What about existing open-source energy projects?"**
   -> "OpenEMS does building energy management. We're doing real-time
      coordination for power electronics - different layer, complementary.
      No one is doing potential field scheduling for hardware coordination."
