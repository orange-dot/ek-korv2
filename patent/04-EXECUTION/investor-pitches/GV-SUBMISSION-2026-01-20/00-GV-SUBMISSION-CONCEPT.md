## The Core Thesis

### What We're Building

**EK-KOR2** - An open-source real-time operating system for distributed power electronics coordination. Think "Kubernetes for energy infrastructure."

### Why Open Source

Google proved this strategy works:
- Android (open) → Mobile ecosystem dominance
- Kubernetes (open) → Cloud orchestration standard
- TensorFlow (open) → ML framework standard

We're applying the same playbook to energy infrastructure.

### Why GV

1. **Open-source DNA** - GV understands ecosystem monetization
2. **Climate portfolio** - Complements Climeworks, Fervo, Form Energy
3. **Patient capital** - Alphabet backing for long-term infrastructure plays
4. **Google synergies** - Natural GCP workload, AI/ML integration

## The Ask

```
$2M SEED ROUND
══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ALLOCATION:
EK-KOR2 open-source launch      $300K   (docs, CI/CD, community)
EK3 hardware development        $700K   (prototype, certification)
EU pilot deployment             $500K   (transit operator partner)
Team expansion                  $400K   (4 engineers)
IP protection                   $100K   (hardware patents)
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
TOTAL                           $2,000K

MILESTONE (12-18 months):

## Why Full Transparency

### The Offer

We're giving GV complete access to:
- All source code (RTOS, kernel, simulator, web app)
- All patent disclosures (10 inventions)
- All technical documentation
- All business strategy documents
- Hardware designs and BOMs

### Why We Can Do This

1. **IP is secured** - Bernstein blockchain timestamps establish priority
2. **Code quality is high** - We're confident in technical review
3. **Strategy is open-source anyway** - Eventually everything goes public
4. **GV understands this** - It's Google's own playbook

### What We're Signaling

- Technical depth, not just pitch deck promises
- Confidence in execution
- Partnership mindset from day one
- Cultural fit with Google's openness

## Competitive Positioning

### Why Incumbents Won't Open-Source

```
ABB / Siemens / ChargePoint:
├── Business model: Proprietary lock-in + service revenue
├── Incentive: Keep coordination closed
├── Result: No interoperability, fragmented market
└── Dilemma: Opening would cannibalize existing revenue

ELEKTROKOMBINACIJA:
├── Business model: Open platform + certified hardware
├── Incentive: Ecosystem adoption = standard creation
├── Result: Network effects, community, talent magnet
└── Advantage: Nothing to lose, everything to gain
```

### The Kubernetes Precedent

Before Kubernetes:
- Every cloud had proprietary orchestration
- No portability, vendor lock-in
- Fragmented tooling

After Kubernetes:
- Open standard won
- Ecosystem exploded
- Google Cloud benefited (GKE)

We're bringing this to energy infrastructure.
