## Key Talking Points

### If They Ask...

**"Why open-source?"**
> Same strategy as Android/Kubernetes/TensorFlow. Open the platform,
> build ecosystem, monetize hardware and services. Google proved this works.

**"What's the moat?"**
> Standard creation moat. Once EK-KOR2 is THE coordination layer, switching
> costs are high. Plus hardware patents on EK3 implementation.

**"Why won't ABB/Siemens do this?"**
> Classic innovator's dilemma. Their business is proprietary lock-in.
> Open-sourcing would cannibalize service revenue. We have nothing to lose.

**"What's the Google Cloud angle?"**
> Every module reports telemetry. High-frequency IoT workload. Predictive
> maintenance ML models. Natural GCP fit, recurring revenue.

**"Why patient capital?"**
> Infrastructure standards take years to establish. Kubernetes took 5+ years
> to dominate. We need a partner who can wait for ecosystem maturity.
