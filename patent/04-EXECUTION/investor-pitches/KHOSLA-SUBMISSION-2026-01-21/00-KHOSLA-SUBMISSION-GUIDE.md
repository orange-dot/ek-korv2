## Target Partners

### Primary: Sven Strohband (Managing Director)

```
WHY SVEN IS PERFECT FIT:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Background:
• Lead engineer Stanford "Stanley" - DARPA Grand Challenge 2005 winner
• Stanley → Google self-driving car program
• "Technologies that forge new industries" is his stated focus

Portfolio Fit:
• Rocket Lab - modular philosophy, vertical integration
• GitLab - open-source strategy, developer ecosystem
• Berkshire Grey - distributed autonomous systems
• Hermeus - deep tech, first-principles engineering

Our Pitch Alignment:
• Open-source RTOS = autonomous coordination (Stanley DNA)
• Standard creation = "forging new industries"
• GitLab parallel = OSS strategy he already backed
• Deep technical content matches his engineering background
```

### Secondary: Vinod Khosla (Founder)

```
WHY VINOD MATTERS:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Background:
• Sun Microsystems co-founder - OSS heritage!
• "Black Swan" approach - big bets on transformative tech
• Climate tech focus with "main tech economics" philosophy

Key Quotes to Reference:
• "More risk is something most people are afraid of, and it's
   where the larger opportunity lies."
• "It is from the depths of the unknown and the unexpected
   that revolutionary innovation emerges."
• "What's needed to lead a company is vision and passion
   and unreasonableness about your mission."

Why He'll Understand:
• Sun pioneered layered OSS (Java OSS, Solaris proprietary)
• He gets strategic IP separation
• Android/Kubernetes playbooks are exactly what we're doing
```

### Tertiary: Samir Kaul (Founding Partner)

```
AI-infused strategies, early-stage company builder
Good backup if Sven is unavailable
Emphasize: AI/ML in fleet optimization, predictive maintenance
```

## Submission Strategy

### Two-Track Approach

**Track 1: General Application (Day 1)**
- Submit via kv@khoslaventures.com
- Attach 01-KHOSLA-SEED-APPLICATION.md
- Professional cover email (see template below)

**Track 2: Direct to Sven Strohband (Day 3-5)**
- LinkedIn connection request
- Direct email with technical focus
- Reference Stanley/autonomous systems connection

### Why Two Tracks

General application ensures we're in the system. Direct outreach to Sven increases chance of technical engagement. Both can succeed; neither conflicts.

### Email A: General Khosla Application

To: kv@khoslaventures.com
Subject: Seed Application - Open-Source Coordination for Distributed Energy

Dear Khosla Ventures team,

We're building the Linux of distributed energy - an open-source RTOS that
will become the coordination standard for modular power infrastructure.

THE BREAKTHROUGH:
EK-KOR2 uses potential field scheduling - modules self-organize through
gradient flow, with no central coordinator. This is a new paradigm for
distributed coordination, enabling scale from 10 to 1000+ modules.

WHY THIS IS A BLACK SWAN BET:
• Technical risk: HIGH (novel scheduling, distributed consensus)
• Market risk: LOW (EU mandates $100B infrastructure buildout)
• Standard creation moat beats patent moat long-term

THE BUSINESS MODEL:
Open-source the OS layer (EK-KOR2, MIT license). Monetize certified
hardware (EK3 modules) and fleet services. Same playbook as Android,
Kubernetes, Red Hat.

TRACTION:
• Working C implementation, 22 test vectors passing
• Infineon partnership for emulator development (NDA in progress)
• Complete EK3 3.3kW module design ready for prototype
• 10 invention disclosures with blockchain priority (Jan 2026)

ASK: $2.5M seed for OSS launch + certified hardware pilot

I've attached our full Seed Fund application following your format.
Full source code available immediately for technical due diligence.

### Email B: Direct to Sven Strohband

Subject: Open-Source RTOS for Autonomous Energy Infrastructure

Sven,

Your work on Stanley proved autonomous systems could operate in
unstructured environments. We're building the coordination layer
that makes distributed energy infrastructure autonomous.

THE BREAKTHROUGH:

EK-KOR2 is an open-source RTOS for modular power electronics.
No central scheduler. Modules self-organize through potential
field gradients - like how biological swarms coordinate.

│  Module 1    Module 2    Module 3    Module 4              │
│  [0.5 load]  [0.3 load]  [0.7 load]  [0.4 load]            │

│         Work flows automatically to low-load nodes          │
│                                                             │
│            NO CENTRAL SCHEDULER - SELF-ORGANIZING           │
└────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

WHY OPEN SOURCE:

Think Linux for servers, Android for mobile, Kubernetes for
cloud. We're creating EK-KOR2 for distributed energy.

Every modular energy system needs coordination. Today: proprietary,
brittle. Tomorrow: industry-standard, open-source foundation.

TECHNICAL DEPTH:

• Dual C/Rust implementation (embedded + safety-critical)
• k=7 topological neighbors (scale-free network theory)
• Threshold consensus (distributed voting, no leader)
• Lock-free IPC (<100ns publish latency)
• Infineon engaged for emulator development

WHY THIS IS A BLACK SWAN BET:

Technical risk is high - novel scheduling, distributed consensus at
scale. But market risk is low - EU mandates guarantee $100B infrastructure
buildout. Standard creation moat compounds over time.

"More risk is something most people are afraid of, and it's where
the larger opportunity lies." - Vinod

ASK: $2.5M seed to open-source EK-KOR2 and build first certified
hardware implementation.

Worth 20 minutes to discuss the autonomous coordination architecture?
I can share complete source code immediately - IP is protected via
blockchain timestamps.

## Conversation Preparation

### Expected Questions and Answers

**"Why open-source? Won't competitors just copy it?"**

> That's exactly the point. When everyone uses our standard, we win.
> Linux is 'copied' by everyone - Red Hat is worth $34B. Android is
> 'copied' by every phone maker - Google owns the ecosystem.
>
> We monetize hardware and services, not the RTOS itself. The more
> adoption of EK-KOR2, the more demand for certified EK3 hardware.

**"What's the potential field scheduling innovation?"**

> Instead of a central coordinator assigning work, each module publishes
> its state - load, thermal, power - as a 'field'. Work flows along
> gradients like water flowing downhill. Emergent coordination, no SPOF.
>
> Mathematical foundation: Khatib's 1986 artificial potential fields,
> adapted from robot navigation to temporal scheduling. Validated
> through property-based testing and cross-implementation comparison.

**"Why dual C/Rust implementation?"**

> C for legacy embedded compatibility and ecosystem adoption. Rust for
> safety-critical paths - Ferrocene just got ASIL-D certification.
> Cross-validation catches bugs. Rust community will contribute -
> they love real hardware projects.

**"How does this relate to Stanley?"**

> Stanley coordinated sensors, actuators, and path planning without
> centralized control. Each subsystem operated autonomously, with
> emergent behavior producing coherent vehicle operation.
>
> EK-KOR2 does the same for power modules. Distributed sensing,
> distributed decision-making, emergent coordination. Same principles,
> different domain.

**"What's the competitive moat if it's open-source?"**

> Standard creation moat. Once EK-KOR2 is THE coordination layer,
> switching costs are high. We have first-mover on ecosystem building,
> plus hardware patents on EK3 implementation.
>
> Linux has been "free" for 30 years. Red Hat made $34B. The standard
> is the moat, not the license.

**"Why won't ABB or Siemens do this?"**

> Classic innovator's dilemma. Their business model is proprietary
> lock-in plus service revenue. Open-sourcing would cannibalize their
> existing revenue streams and alienate current customers.
>
> They can't move fast enough, and they can't buy the community. When
> we have 1000 contributors, that's our moat - not a feature they can
> copy.

**"What's the Infineon relationship?"**

> Infineon is engaged for emulator development collaboration. They've
> seen our source code, we're signing NDA for their timing specifications.
>
> This validates the technical approach - a €50B semiconductor giant
> doesn't waste time on research curiosities. They see production path.
