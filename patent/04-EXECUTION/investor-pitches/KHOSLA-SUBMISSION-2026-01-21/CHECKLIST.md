## Key Talking Points

### Quick Reference

**Why open-source?**
> Linux strategy. Standard creation moat beats patent moat. Red Hat made $34B.

**What's the innovation?**
> Potential field scheduling. No central coordinator. Emergent coordination.

**Why now?**
> EU 2035 mandate + no existing standard + Rust/Ferrocene maturity.

**What's the moat?**
> Standard creation. Once we're THE coordination layer, switching costs are permanent.

**Why Khosla?**
> Vinod's Sun heritage (OSS), Sven's autonomous systems (Stanley), portfolio fit (GitLab).

## Notes

### What Makes This Pitch Khosla-Specific

1. **Black Swan framing** - High technical risk, low market risk
2. **Main tech economics** - Works without subsidies
3. **OSS strategy** - Vinod's Sun heritage
4. **Autonomous systems** - Sven's Stanley connection
5. **Standard creation** - Long-term platform thinking

### What to Avoid

- Revenue projections ("all forecasts are wrong" - Khosla)
- "Clean tech" framing (use economics instead)
- Competitive comparisons (focus on category creation)
- Timeline estimates (they don't want "quick fix")
