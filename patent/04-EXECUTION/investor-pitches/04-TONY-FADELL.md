## Kako Pozicionirati Elektrokombinaciju

### Fadell Frame: PRODUCT + MANUFACTURING STORY

```
FADELL RESONANCE POINTS:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. ELEGANCE OF BLADE SERVER APPROACH
   - "What if chargers worked like servers?"
   - Jednostavan koncept, duboka implikacija
   - iPod moment: "1000 songs in your pocket"
   - Naš: "One module, any power level"

2. DESIGN FOR MANUFACTURING (DFM)
   - Jedan modul dizajn za sve aplikacije
   - Volume production benefits
   - Supply chain simplicity
   - "Tesla-like manufacturing innovation"

3. CUSTOMER OBSESSION
   - Fleet operator pain point je JASAN
   - Downtime = lost revenue + stranded buses
   - Rešenje je intuitivno

4. HARDWARE AS MOAT
   - Software se kopira brzo
   - Hardware + robotics + patents = defensibility
   - "Hard things are worth doing"

5. CLIMATE IMPACT
   - Reliable charging = more electrification
   - Infrastructure that enables transition

## Tailored Messaging

### NEMOJ reći → RECI ovako:

| Generički | Fadell-optimizovano |
|-----------|---------------------|
| "Modularni punjač" | "One module design for any power level" |
| "Bolji uptime" | "Customer obsession: zero stranded buses" |
| "Skalabilno" | "DFM from day one - volume production ready" |
| "Inovativno" | "Hardware moat that compounds over time" |
| "Patenti" | "Defensibility through atoms, not just bits" |
| "Robot zamena" | "Elegant solution: 40-second self-repair" |

Subject: Blade Server Thinking for EV Charging - Hardware Play

Hi Tony,

I've been thinking about your concept of "things worth making"
while building modular EV charging infrastructure.

THE PRODUCT INSIGHT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
What if EV chargers worked like blade servers?

One module design (3kW) that scales from 3kW to 3MW.
Failed module? Robot swaps it in 40 seconds.
No technician trucks. No downtime. Self-healing infrastructure.

WHY HARDWARE MATTERS HERE:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Software solutions can optimize around broken chargers.
We're fixing the chargers themselves.

The moat is in atoms:
• DFM-optimized module (one design, volume production)
• Robotic swap station (physical automation)
• 5 patents filed (WIPO PROOF Jan 2026)

CUSTOMER OBSESSION:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Fleet operators have one nightmare: stranded buses.
A bus that can't charge is a bus that can't run.
We're eliminating that failure mode.

THE ASK:
Would value 20 minutes to discuss the manufacturing approach.
Your Nest experience with hardware scale is exactly the
perspective I need.

Best,
Bojan Janjatović
Founder, Elektrokombinacija

## One-Pager: Product/Manufacturing Focus

```
ELEKTROKOMBINACIJA
One Module. Any Power Level. Zero Downtime.
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE PRODUCT INSIGHT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
EV chargers today are like mainframes in the 1970s.
Monolithic. Expensive to repair. Single points of failure.

We're bringing blade server architecture to energy:
One modular unit that scales to any power level.

└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

DESIGN FOR MANUFACTURING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• One SKU to manufacture (not dozens)
• Volume production economics
• Simplified supply chain
• Quality through repetition

THE REPAIR REVOLUTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Module fails → Robot detects → Robot swaps → 40 seconds
No truck. No technician. No downtime.

Customer impact: Zero stranded buses, ever.

WHY THIS IS HARD (AND WHY THAT'S GOOD)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Power electronics at scale
• Thermal management in compact form factor
• Robotics integration
• Real-world reliability requirements

Hardware moats compound. Software gets copied.

CLIMATE IMPACT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Reliable infrastructure enables electrification.
Every percentage point of uptime improvement =
thousands of electric miles replacing diesel.

DEFENSIBILITY
━━━━━━━━━━━━━
5 patent concepts (WIPO PROOF Jan 2026)
Hardware + robotics + manufacturing = compounding moat

MARKET
━━━━━━
$100B+ EU bus fleet electrification by 2035
First-mover on modular architecture

THE ASK
━━━━━━━
$1.5M seed for prototype and first pilot
Looking for investors who understand hardware scale
```
