Subject: Autonomous EV Charging Infrastructure - Climeworks Model for Fleet Electrification

Erik,

GV's climate thesis is clear: back breakthrough technologies that
can scale. Climeworks for carbon capture. Commonwealth Fusion for
generation. Fervo for geothermal. Form for storage.

We're building the missing layer: breakthrough DISTRIBUTION
infrastructure for electric fleets.

THE PROBLEM
───────────
Electric bus operators face 15-30% charger downtime. Current
chargers are monolithic—when they fail, buses don't charge.
Operators are hesitant to electrify because infrastructure
reliability isn't there.

THE BREAKTHROUGH
────────────────
Modular "blade server" architecture for EV charging:

┌──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  ┌───┐ ┌───┐ ┌───┐ ┌─X─┐ ┌───┐ ┌───┐ ┌───┐ ┌───┐       │
│  │3kW│ │3kW│ │3kW│ │ ↓ │ │3kW│ │3kW│ │3kW│ │3kW│       │
│  └───┘ └───┘ └───┘ └───┘ └───┘ └───┘ └───┘ └───┘       │
│         Autonomous robot swaps failed module in 40 sec   │
│              Zero truck rolls. Zero downtime.            │
└──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

• Single 3kW module scales from 3kW to 3MW
• Hot-swappable during operation (graceful degradation)
• Robotic swap station—no human intervention
• Fleet logistics: buses transport spare modules
• AI ROJ coordination across depot

THE CLIMEWORKS PARALLEL
───────────────────────
Climeworks proved modular DAC could scale.
We're proving modular charging can scale.

Same thesis: Small, standardized units.
Manufacturing scale. Autonomous operation.

WHY GV
──────
This is a 10-year infrastructure bet. We need patient capital
with technical depth. GV's climate portfolio shows you understand
breakthrough energy infrastructure plays.

TRACTION
────────
• 5 patent concepts (WIPO PROOF priority Jan 2026)
• EK3 module: 3.3kW, 900V SiC, LLC topology
• Technical architecture validated
• Target: EU transit operators (100% electric mandate by 2035)

ASK
───
$2M seed for prototype + first pilot deployment in Europe.

Happy to walk through the technical architecture with your team.

## Email Template B: To Karim Faris (Infrastructure + Climate)

```
Subject: Infrastructure Layer for Fleet Electrification

Karim,

You led GV's investment in Climeworks—modular carbon capture
that can scale. We're building the same model for a different
problem: EV fleet charging infrastructure.

THE INSIGHT
───────────
Data centers went from monolithic servers to blade architecture.
Energy infrastructure is stuck in the monolithic era.

THE BREAKTHROUGH
────────────────
• Modular 3kW power units (EK3) that scale to 3MW
• Autonomous robotic maintenance—40-second module swap
• Self-healing infrastructure, zero human intervention
• Technical depth: 900V SiC MOSFETs, LLC topology, CAN-FD

WHY NOW
───────
• EU mandates 100% electric city buses by 2035
• $100B+ infrastructure buildout happening now
• Current charger reliability (70-85%) blocks fleet adoption
• First-mover advantage on autonomous maintenance architecture

THE TECHNICAL MOAT
──────────────────
5 patent concepts, WIPO PROOF priority established:
1. Modular hot-swap architecture
2. Robotic swap mechanism
3. Fleet-integrated logistics
4. Distributed sparing system
5. Dual-robot coordination

This is hard engineering. Power electronics + robotics +
AI coordination. Others won't replicate quickly.

THE MARKET
──────────
TAM: €100B (EU bus fleet electrification)
SAM: €10B (charging infrastructure)
SOM: €500M (reliability/maintenance layer—our wedge)

ASK
───
$2M seed. Prototype + EU pilot deployment.

Would value 30 minutes to discuss the technical approach.

## Email Template C: To Tom Hulme (Europe + Design)

```
Subject: European EV Infrastructure - Design-Led Approach

Tom,

With your IDEO background and European focus, wanted to share
what we're building: elegantly simple EV charging infrastructure
that maintains itself.

THE DESIGN PRINCIPLE
────────────────────
Current EV chargers are like 1990s servers—monolithic, fragile,
requiring expert intervention when they fail.

We designed for autonomous operation from first principles:
• Modular units that a robot can handle
• Standardized form factor (blade server aesthetic)
• Graceful degradation, not catastrophic failure
• Self-healing through automated swap

THE EUROPEAN OPPORTUNITY
────────────────────────
• EU mandates 100% electric buses by 2035
• Transit operators desperate for reliable charging
• European transit authorities prefer local partners
• €100B+ infrastructure investment coming

WHY GV FOR EUROPE
─────────────────
We're targeting EU transit operators for first deployment.
Your European presence + Alphabet's resources would accelerate
market entry significantly.

Would love to share the industrial design work and discuss
GV's European strategy.

Current state:
• Chargers have 15-30% downtime

## Conversation Prep

### Expected Questions from GV:

1. **"How does this relate to our climate portfolio?"**
   → "You've invested in generation (Commonwealth Fusion), storage
      (Form Energy), and carbon capture (Climeworks). We're the
      distribution layer—getting clean energy to electric fleets
      reliably."

2. **"What's the technical risk?"**
   → "Power electronics and robotics integration is challenging,
      but both technologies are proven. We're combining them in
      a novel architecture. The real risk is execution, not physics."

3. **"Why won't ABB/Siemens do this?"**
   → "They're invested in monolithic architectures. Switching would
      cannibalize existing products. Classic innovator's dilemma.
      By the time they react, we'll have deployed base + IP moat."

4. **"What's the Google synergy?"**
   → "Fleet optimization uses routing/logistics (Maps DNA).
      Predictive maintenance is an ML problem (Cloud AI).
      Autonomous systems are core Alphabet competency (Waymo).
      We'd leverage GV Startup Lab for all of these."

5. **"Why do you need patient capital?"**
   → "Hardware for infrastructure takes time. We're not building
      an app—we're building critical infrastructure that needs
      to last 20+ years. GV's Alphabet backing means you can wait
      for the right outcome, not force premature exit."

## Key Differentiators for GV

### What sets us apart from other climate deals:

```
1. IMMEDIATE REVENUE PATH
   Unlike fusion or DAC, EV charging has paying customers TODAY.
   Transit operators have budgets allocated.

2. CLEAR REGULATORY TAILWIND
   EU 2035 mandate is law, not aspiration.
   Demand is guaranteed.

3. MODULAR = LOWER CAPITAL INTENSITY
   Don't need to build one big factory.
   Can scale manufacturing gradually.

4. AUTONOMOUS = LOWER OPEX
   Self-maintaining infrastructure is a defensible business model.
   Not just a product—a platform.

5. EUROPEAN BEACHHEAD
   Tom Hulme's European presence = strategic advantage.
   EU transit operators prefer European partners.
```

---

## Competitive Positioning

### If asked about competition:

```
TRADITIONAL CHARGER COMPANIES:
"ABB, Siemens, ChargePoint are optimizing monolithic architecture.
 We're replacing the architecture entirely."

OTHER MODULAR APPROACHES (Kempower, etc.):
"Others do modular for manufacturing efficiency.
 We do modular + autonomous maintenance = different business model.
 They still send technicians. We don't."

SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS:
"Software optimizes around broken hardware.
 We fix the hardware. Fundamentally different approach."

WHY THEY WON'T COPY:
"Requires power electronics + robotics + AI expertise.
 Incumbents are charger companies, not autonomous systems companies.
 18-24 month head start + IP moat."
```
