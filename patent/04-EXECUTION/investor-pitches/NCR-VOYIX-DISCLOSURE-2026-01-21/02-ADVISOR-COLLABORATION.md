## Benefits to NCR Voyix

Working with these advisors on my personal project brings knowledge and skills that benefit my work at NCR Voyix:

| Area | Skills Developed | NCR Voyix Relevance |
|------|------------------|---------------|
| **Distributed systems** | Consensus algorithms, fault tolerance, coordination | Backend systems, distributed architecture |
| **Real-time systems** | RTOS design, deterministic scheduling, low-latency IPC | Performance-critical components |
| **Embedded development** | Bare-metal programming, HAL design, memory-constrained systems | IoT, edge computing |
| **Formal methods** | Property-based testing, cross-validation, verification | Code quality, reliability |
| **Mission-critical design** | Patterns from 911 systems, Azure infrastructure | High-availability systems |

### The Informal Advisor Angle

My infrastructure advisor friend cannot participate formally—his employer strictly prohibits it. But what he *can* share privately, without violating any agreements, is **decades of hard-won experience**:

| Experience Source | What I Learn | NCR Voyix Benefit |
|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| **Bell Labs training** | Engineering discipline, rigorous thinking | Better architecture decisions |
| **First responders network** | Systems where failure = lives lost | Reliability-first mindset |
| **Critical Azure infrastructure** | Hyperscale operations, incident response | Cloud operations perspective |
| **17 years mission-critical** | Patterns that survive production | Fewer "learning the hard way" moments |

This is knowledge that would cost a fortune to acquire through formal consulting. He shares it freely with me as a friend—lessons learned, patterns that work, mistakes to avoid. No proprietary details, no current project specifics, just the wisdom that comes from building systems that *cannot fail*.

**NCR Voyix gets this for free** through my improved engineering judgment.

### Open Source Commitment

**The kernel and operating system will be open source.** This means:
- The knowledge I gain is not locked away in proprietary code
- Best practices flow freely between my side project and NCR Voyix work
- NCR Voyix benefits from skills developed on cutting-edge distributed systems research

- **"Combined cooperative control and topology control"** - joint project with TU Hamburg-Harburg Institute of Control Systems
- Supervised BSc/MSc students on: wireless sensor networks, particle filtering (sequential Monte Carlo), UAV navigation using wireless sensor measurements
- Teaching: computer networks, computer architecture, wireless networks, localized network structures

### Current Role (2021-Present)

**EU defense/telecom sector** - Senior Solutions Architect
- Tactical communications systems
- Military cloud infrastructure (OpenStack-based)
- Solution and system architecture for defense applications

*Employer name not disclosed - defense sector confidentiality requirements*

### Why This Background Matters

This is **exactly** the expertise needed for EK-KOR2:

| His Research | EK-KOR2 Application |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Topology control algorithms | k=7 neighbor selection |
| Distributed data fusion | Potential field coordination |
| Wireless sensor networks | CAN-FD module communication |
| Belief functions | Consensus under uncertainty |
| Large-scale testbeds | 1000+ module scaling |
| Tactical communications | Mission-critical reliability |

**15+ years** of academic research in distributed systems, now applied to real defense infrastructure. This is the kind of advisor you can't buy - you have to know them personally.

### Nature of Collaboration

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Timing | Weekends only |
| Frequency | 1-2 sessions per month |
| Format | Remote, asynchronous mostly |
| Duration | 2-4 hours per session |

### Focus Areas

- Algorithm formalization (academic rigor)
- Distributed systems theory
- Multi-agent coordination algorithms (MAPF-HET)
- Potential academic publications

### Characteristics

- **Slow-paced** - No deadlines, no production pressure
- **Academic** - Research for potential papers, not commercial development
- **Fits both schedules** - Weekend work suits their constraints too
- **No commercial involvement** - Purely technical/research collaboration

### Example Work (Recent Session)

Recent session focused on integrating Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF-HET) algorithms into our coordination kernel. See 03-SESSION-UPDATE-2026-01-20.md for details.

## Infrastructure Advisor

### Background

| Attribute | Detail |
|-----------|--------|
| Location | United States (East Coast) |
| Education | Bell Labs (yes, *that* Bell Labs) |
| Experience | 17 years critical infrastructure |
| Domain | First responders network (East Coast) |
| Current role | **Commercial** critical Azure infrastructure |
| Clarification | **NOT military cloud** - commercial Azure only |
| Previous | US security clearance (sensitive government work, no longer active) |
| Software | 5+ years software engineering |
| Focus | Mission-critical systems |
| Relationship | Personal friend (childhood connection) |

### Nature of Collaboration

**This is informal—formal participation is not possible.**

He works on critical Azure infrastructure. His employer does not allow him to share any details about current projects with anyone, under any circumstances. Formal advisory roles, public attribution, or disclosure of project specifics are strictly prohibited.

**What he shares vs. what he doesn't:**

| NOT Shared (prohibited) | Shared (permitted) |
|-------------------------|-------------------|
| Azure-specific architecture | General design principles |
| Internal tooling, source code | Patterns that work in mission-critical systems |
| Customer data, security details | Lessons learned from 17-year career |
| Current project specifics | "When building reliable systems, think about X" |

**Security clearance context:** He previously held US security clearance for sensitive government work. He no longer works on military cloud or classified projects. Clearance restrictions apply only to classified information from that period—not to general engineering wisdom accumulated over a career. This distinction is well-understood in the industry; engineers move between companies and carry their *experience* (not proprietary details) with them.

**What he can do:** Share general experience and lessons learned from 17 years in critical infrastructure—the kind of wisdom that comes from building systems where failure means people don't get help when they call 911. No Azure internals, no proprietary details, just career-spanning engineering judgment shared between friends.

We've thought this through carefully. He stays well within his contractual boundaries. I get invaluable perspective. NCR Voyix benefits from my improved engineering judgment. Everyone wins.

### Characteristics

- **Informal only** - No formal advisory agreement
- **Personal friendship** - Known each other for decades
- **Occasional guidance** - When relevant topics come up
- **No commercial involvement** - Just a friend sharing perspective
- **No expectation of attribution** - He doesn't want or need credit

### Why Mentioned

I'm including this relationship for completeness. It's relevant because his experience with first-responder networks has influenced how I think about reliability and fault tolerance. But it's a personal friendship, not a business relationship.

## Confidentiality Request

Both advisors prefer discretion:

1. **Distributed Systems Advisor:** Defense sector employment requires it. I can disclose identity to NCR Voyix under confidence if needed.

2. **Infrastructure Advisor:** Simply doesn't want attention. Personal friend helping out, not seeking recognition.

I've disclosed these relationships here because I believe in transparency. I'm asking that NCR Voyix treat these details as confidential internal information.
