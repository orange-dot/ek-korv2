## Benefits to NCR Voyix

Working with this advisor on my personal project brings knowledge and skills that benefit my work at NCR Voyix:

| Area | Skills Developed | NCR Voyix Relevance |
|------|------------------|---------------|
| **Distributed systems** | Consensus algorithms, fault tolerance, coordination | Backend systems, distributed architecture |
| **Real-time systems** | RTOS design, deterministic scheduling, low-latency IPC | Performance-critical components |
| **Embedded development** | Bare-metal programming, HAL design, memory-constrained systems | IoT, edge computing |
| **Formal methods** | Property-based testing, cross-validation, verification | Code quality, reliability |

### Open Source Commitment

**The kernel and operating system will be open source.** This means:
- The knowledge I gain is not locked away in proprietary code
- Best practices flow freely between my side project and NCR Voyix work
- NCR Voyix benefits from skills developed on cutting-edge distributed systems research

**CONFIDENTIAL - FOR NCR VOYIX INTERNAL USE ONLY**

### Full Academic & Research Background

| Period | Institution | Role | Focus |
|--------|-------------|------|-------|
| 2008-2011 | **INRIA Lille - Nord Europe** (France) | PhD Researcher | "Algorithms for Realistic Wireless Sensor Networks" |
| 2012-2013 | **University of Novi Sad** (Serbia) | Postdoctoral Researcher | Large-scale testbeds (SensLAB), energy-efficient protocols |
| 2013-2015 | **Université de Technologie de Compiègne** (France) | Postdoctoral Researcher | "Distributed Algorithms and Theory of Belief Functions" (Labex MS2T) |
| 2015-2019 | **University of Koblenz-Landau** (Germany) | Postdoctoral Researcher | DFG-funded projects, collaboration with TU Hamburg-Harburg |
| 2021-Present | EU defense/telecom sector | Senior Solutions Architect | **Tactical communications, military cloud infrastructure** |

### PhD Research (INRIA Lille, 2008-2011)

**Thesis:** "Algorithms for Realistic Wireless Sensor Networks"

Key achievements:
- Topology control algorithm based on relative neighborhood graph reduction
- Transmission range adaptation algorithms using neighborhood discovery protocol
- Large-scale WSN emulation (50+ sensor nodes)
- Geographical routing algorithms with link quality metrics (ETX, RSSI)

### Postdoctoral Research Highlights

**Compiègne, France (2013-2015)** - Labex MS2T funded:
- Distributed data fusion using theory of belief functions
- Dangerous road event detection (icy roads) using wireless sensors
- Experimental testbed with ZigBee sensors and road-side units (RSU)
- Software development on Airplug platform (Heudiasyc Laboratory)

**Koblenz, Germany (2015-2019)** - DFG funded:
- **"Reactive Spanner"** - local topology control in wireless sensor networks
- **"Combined cooperative control and topology control"** - joint project with TU Hamburg-Harburg Institute of Control Systems
- Supervised BSc/MSc students on: wireless sensor networks, particle filtering (sequential Monte Carlo), UAV navigation using wireless sensor measurements
- Teaching: computer networks, computer architecture, wireless networks, localized network structures

### Current Role (2021-Present)

**EU defense/telecom sector** - Senior Solutions Architect
- Tactical communications systems
- Military cloud infrastructure (OpenStack-based)
- Solution and system architecture for defense applications

*Employer name not disclosed - defense sector confidentiality requirements*

### Why This Background Matters

This is **exactly** the expertise needed for EK-KOR2:

| His Research | EK-KOR2 Application |
|--------------|---------------------|
| Topology control algorithms | k=7 neighbor selection |
| Distributed data fusion | Potential field coordination |
| Wireless sensor networks | CAN-FD module communication |
| Belief functions | Consensus under uncertainty |
| Large-scale testbeds | 1000+ module scaling |
| Tactical communications | Mission-critical reliability |

**15+ years** of academic research in distributed systems, now applied to real defense infrastructure. This is the kind of advisor you can't buy - you have to know them personally.

### Nature of Collaboration

| Aspect | Detail |
|--------|--------|
| Timing | Weekends only |
| Frequency | 1-2 sessions per month |
| Format | Remote, asynchronous mostly |
| Duration | 2-4 hours per session |

### Focus Areas

- Algorithm formalization (academic rigor)
- Distributed systems theory
- Multi-agent coordination algorithms (MAPF-HET)
- Potential academic publications

### Characteristics

- **Slow-paced** - No deadlines, no production pressure
- **Academic** - Research for potential papers, not commercial development
- **Fits both schedules** - Weekend work suits their constraints too
- **No commercial involvement** - Purely technical/research collaboration

### Example Work (Recent Session)

Recent session focused on integrating Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF-HET) algorithms into our coordination kernel. See 03-SESSION-UPDATE-2026-01-20.md for details.

## Confidentiality Request

The advisor prefers discretion due to defense sector employment. I can disclose identity to NCR Voyix under confidence if needed.

I've disclosed this relationship here because I believe in transparency. I'm asking that NCR Voyix treat these details as confidential internal information.
