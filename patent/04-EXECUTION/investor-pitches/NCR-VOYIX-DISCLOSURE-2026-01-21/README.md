**Purpose:** Full transparency about personal side project

## What This Is

This is an informal disclosure of my personal side project (Elektrokombinacija) to NCR Voyix management. It is provided for transparency, not as a pitch or proposal.

**Key question:** Do we need any additional non-compete agreement?
