# Disclosure Summary: Personal Side Project

**Date:** January 21, 2026
**From:** Bojan Janjatovic
**To:** Luka, NCR Voyix
**Re:** Transparency about personal project

## Why I'm Sharing This

You've known my work for 5 years at NCR Voyix. I want to be completely transparent about a side project I've been developing on personal time. This isn't a pitch or an ask—it's simply full disclosure because I believe in operating with transparency.

**My question at the end:** Do we need any additional non-compete agreement or similar arrangement?

---

## The Short Version

- **Project:** Elektrokombinacija - modular EV charging infrastructure for electric bus fleets
- **Company:** Netherlands BV, my wife Marija is CEO (100% dedicated)
- **My role:** CTO - technical architecture, now in oversight mode
- **Development status:** ~95% complete (kernel, HALs, test systems all working)
- **What remains:** Business-side activities (Marija handles all of it)

---

## My NCR Voyix Commitment

**100% focus on NCR Voyix continues unchanged.**

Let me be direct:
- I'm not leaving NCR Voyix
- I'm not reducing my commitment
- The technical development work is essentially done
- What remains is business development, which Marija handles full-time

The engineering work happens on evenings and weekends—my personal time. It doesn't interfere with my NCR Voyix responsibilities.

---

## Current Status

**Development phase is complete:**
- Real-time kernel (EK-KOR2) - working
- Hardware abstraction layers - working
- Test systems - comprehensive coverage
- Technical documentation - complete

**Business phase is Marija's domain:**
- Investor conversations
- Partnership discussions
- Regulatory compliance
- Operations planning

I provide technical oversight when needed, but this is advisory, not development work.

## Weekend Research Collaboration

I have a research collaboration with a PhD-level distributed systems expert (official advisor). Important context:

- **Timing:** Weekends only (suits all our work schedules)
- **Nature:** Academic research, algorithm formalization
- **Pace:** Slow, no deadlines, no production pressure
- **Purpose:** Potential academic publications, not commercial development

Details on the advisor are in the accompanying document (02-ADVISOR-COLLABORATION.md).

## How This Benefits NCR Voyix

Working with this advisor brings knowledge back to NCR Voyix—at no cost to the company:

| Source | What I Learn | NCR Voyix Benefit |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| **PhD distributed systems advisor** | Consensus algorithms, formal methods | Better architecture decisions |
| **15+ years academic research** | Rigorous algorithm design | Higher code quality |
| **Defense sector experience** | Mission-critical systems patterns | Reliability-first mindset |

**This is knowledge that would cost a fortune through formal consulting. NCR Voyix gets it for free through my improved engineering judgment.**

**The kernel and operating system will be open source.** Knowledge flows freely—nothing locked away.

## What I'm Asking

**Do we need any additional non-compete agreement or similar arrangement between me and NCR Voyix regarding this project?**

I'm genuinely asking for guidance here. If NCR Voyix's legal or compliance team wants additional protections, I'm happy to discuss reasonable arrangements. My goal is to be completely above-board about this.

## Materials Included

This package contains:

1. **01-PROJECT-OVERVIEW.md** - What the project actually is
2. **02-ADVISOR-COLLABORATION.md** - Details on external collaborators
3. **03-SESSION-UPDATE-2026-01-20.md** - Example of weekend research work
4. **ncr-technical-package-2026-01-21.zip** - Full source code (for complete transparency)
5. **README.md** - Package navigation

I'm providing full technical materials because I have nothing to hide. This is a side project in a completely different domain (EV infrastructure) from NCR Voyix's business (retail and banking technology).

## Contact

I'm happy to discuss any of this in person. Just let me know what questions you have.
