## Khosla-ova Filozofija (iz njegovog pisanja)

### Ključne tačke koje MORAŠ pogoditi:

1. **AI kao "parni motor za mozak"**
   - Ne samo alat, već multiplikator ljudskih sposobnosti
   - Self-healing infrastructure = AI-driven autonomija

2. **Platform Shift > Incremental Improvement**
   - Traži disrupciju, ne evoluciju
   - "Blade server za energetiku" = nova paradigma

3. **Demokratizacija tehnologije**
   - Tehnologija za milijarde, ne samo elite
   - EV infrastruktura dostupna SVUDA, ne samo bogatim gradovima

4. **Post-scarcity ekonomija**
   - Abundance through automation
   - Zero human intervention = beskonačna skalabilnost

5. **Geopolitička hitnost**
   - Evropa vs Kina u EV utrci
   - Energetska nezavisnost kao strateški imperativ

6. **"Why Now" timing**
   - Regulativa + tehnologija = savršen trenutak
   - First-mover advantage

Subject: Self-Healing EV Infrastructure - Robotics meets Clean Energy

Dear Khosla Ventures team,

Electric bus fleets face a hidden crisis: 15-30% charger downtime.
A single failure can strand an entire fleet. Current solution?
Wait days for a technician truck.

We're building something different:

BLADE SERVER ARCHITECTURE FOR EV CHARGING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• One 3kW module scales from 3kW to 3MW
• Robot swaps failed module in 40 seconds
• Self-healing infrastructure, zero human intervention
• AI monitoring: early detection when possible, instant response when needed

This isn't incremental improvement—it's a platform shift.
Like servers went from monolithic to modular, so will energy
infrastructure.

WHY THIS MATTERS GLOBALLY:
Current EV charging demands expensive maintenance teams.
Our approach enables reliable EV infrastructure EVERYWHERE—
not just wealthy cities, but emerging markets where
electrification matters most for climate impact.

WHY NOW:
• EU mandates 100% electric city buses by 2035
• $100B+ infrastructure build-out happening NOW
• 5 patent concepts secured (WIPO PROOF, Jan 2026)
• First-mover on robotic maintenance approach

THE ASK:
$1-2M seed to build working prototype and secure
first pilot with European transit operator.

Would welcome 15 minutes to show you why robotic
self-healing infrastructure is the future of clean energy.

### Problem (1 paragraf)
```
Electric fleet operators face 15-30% charger downtime. When a
charger fails, buses sit idle for hours or days waiting for
technician trucks. This unreliability is the #1 barrier to
fleet electrification—and current solutions don't scale.
```

• Single 3kW module (EK3) scales from 3kW to 3MW
• Hot-swappable—no system shutdown required
• Robotic swap station at depot
• Buses transport replacement modules (fleet logistics)
• AI monitors continuously: detects early OR responds instantly to failures
```

### Why Now
```
• EU 2035 mandate: 100% electric city buses
• $100B+ charging infrastructure needed
• Current solutions: monolithic, fragile, expensive
• We're first to apply blade-server thinking to energy
```

### Traction
```
• 5 patent concepts with priority date (WIPO PROOF Jan 2026)
• Technical architecture validated
• Target customers identified: European transit operators
```

### Market
```
TAM: €100B+ (EU bus fleet electrification by 2035)
SAM: €10B (charging infrastructure)
SOM: €500M (maintenance/reliability segment)

**Company name:** Elektrokombinacija

**One-line description:**
"Self-healing EV charging infrastructure using robotic module swapping"

**What problem are you solving?**
```
Electric fleet operators face 15-30% charger downtime, the #1 barrier
to fleet electrification. Current chargers are monolithic—when they
fail, entire fleets are stranded waiting for technician trucks.
```

**What is your solution?**
```
Blade-server architecture for EV charging. Modular 3kW power units
that scale from 3kW to 3MW. When a module degrades OR fails, a robot swaps it
in 40 seconds. Zero truck rolls, zero technician visits, 95%+ uptime.
Self-healing infrastructure - works whether we detect early or respond instantly.
```

**Why now?**
```
EU mandates 100% electric city buses by 2035, creating $100B+
infrastructure demand. Fleet operators are discovering current
charging solutions don't scale. We're first-movers on modular
architecture with robotic maintenance—the same shift that
transformed data centers is coming to energy infrastructure.
```

**Why you?**
