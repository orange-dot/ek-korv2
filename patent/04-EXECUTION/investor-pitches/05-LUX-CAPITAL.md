## Josh Wolfe Filozofija

### Iz njegovih intervjua, tweets, i predavanja:

1. **"Directional Arrow of Progress"**
   - Tehnologija ide u jednom smeru
   - Pitanje je KADA, ne DA LI

2. **"Science Fiction → Science Fact"**
   - Investira u stvari koje izgledaju futuristički
   - Ali su zasnovane na realnoj nauci

3. **"Rebellious Scientists and Engineers"**
   - Voli contrarian founders
   - Oni koji rade ono što "ne može"

4. **"Atoms, Not Just Bits"**
   - Deep tech u fizičkom svetu
   - Hardware, robotics, materials

5. **"Narrative Violation"**
   - Investicije koje krše mainstream narativ
   - Kontra-intuitivne teze

6. **"Show, Don't Tell"**
   - Demo > pitch deck
   - Working prototype > PowerPoint

## Kako Pozicionirati Elektrokombinaciju

### Lux Frame: CONTRARIAN + DEEP TECH

```
LUX RESONANCE POINTS:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. NARRATIVE VIOLATION
   "Everyone says EV charging is a software problem.
    We say it's a HARDWARE ARCHITECTURE problem."

   The contrarian thesis: You can't software your way
   out of physical infrastructure failure.

2. SCIENCE FICTION → SCIENCE FACT
   "Self-healing infrastructure" sounds like sci-fi
   But it's just robotics + modular design + ML
   The pieces exist, no one combined them this way

3. DIRECTIONAL ARROW
   Inevitable: Fleet electrification
   Inevitable: Robotic maintenance
   Inevitable: Modular infrastructure
   We're just accelerating the timeline

4. ATOMS > BITS
   Real hardware, real robotics, real patents
   Not another SaaS dashboard for broken chargers

5. REBELLIOUS APPROACH
   Big players (ABB, Siemens) won't do this
   Too different from their monolithic architectures
   Underdog opportunity
```

## Tailored Messaging

### NEMOJ reći → RECI ovako:

| Generički | Lux-optimizovano |
|-----------|------------------|
| "Bolja tehnologija" | "Narrative violation in EV infrastructure" |
| "Inovativno" | "Science fiction made real" |
| "Prvi na tržištu" | "Directional arrow - inevitable, we're first" |
| "Patenti" | "Atoms-based moat (hardware + robotics)" |
| "Modularno" | "Rebellious architecture vs incumbent monoliths" |
| "Demo" | "Show, don't tell - watch the robot swap" |

Subject: Narrative Violation in EV Charging Infrastructure

Josh,

The mainstream narrative: EV charging is a software problem.
Optimize routes around broken chargers. Better scheduling.
Dashboard for downtime.

The contrarian thesis: You can't software your way out of
broken atoms.

We're building hardware that fixes itself:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• Modular "blade server" architecture for chargers
• Robot swaps failed module in 40 seconds
• Self-healing infrastructure (sounds sci-fi, isn't)
• 5 patents filed (WIPO PROOF Jan 2026)

THE DIRECTIONAL ARROW:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Fleet electrification → inevitable
Infrastructure reliability requirements → increasing
Robotic maintenance → inevitable
Modular architecture → inevitable

We're accelerating what's coming anyway.

WHY INCUMBENTS WON'T DO THIS:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
ABB, Siemens, ChargePoint - all monolithic architectures.
Switching to modular would cannibalize existing products.
Classic innovator's dilemma. Classic Lux opportunity.

Show, don't tell: Would love to demo the swap mechanism.
40 seconds. Real hardware. Real robotics.

Bojan Janjatović
Founder, Elektrokombinacija

## One-Pager: Contrarian Thesis Version

```
ELEKTROKOMBINACIJA
The Contrarian Thesis in EV Infrastructure
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

THE MAINSTREAM NARRATIVE
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
"EV charging is a software problem"
- Better scheduling algorithms
- Route optimization around failures
- Predictive dashboards
- VC money flowing to software layers

THE NARRATIVE VIOLATION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
You can't software your way out of broken atoms.

When a charger fails physically, software can only route
around it. The charger stays broken. The bus stays uncharged.
The diesel backup starts running.

THE HARDWARE SOLUTION
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Self-healing infrastructure through robotic module swapping.

┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  SCIENCE FICTION          →        SCIENCE FACT             │
│  ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────  │
│  "Self-repairing machines"         Robotic hot-swap         │
│  "Modular everything"              Blade server for energy  │
│  "Zero downtime"                   40-second replacement    │
│  "AI-maintained infrastructure"    Predictive + autonomous  │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘

DIRECTIONAL ARROW OF PROGRESS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
These things are inevitable:
✓ Fleet electrification (EU 2035 mandate)
✓ Higher reliability requirements (as fleets grow)
✓ Robotic maintenance (labor costs + speed)
✓ Modular infrastructure (manufacturing economics)

Question isn't IF. Question is WHO and WHEN.

WHY INCUMBENTS CAN'T DO THIS
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
• ABB: Invested in monolithic architecture
• Siemens: Same
• ChargePoint: Software-first, hardware outsourced
• BorgWarner/Delphi: Automotive mindset, not infra

Switching would cannibalize existing products.
They'll wait until forced. We'll be there waiting.

THE ATOMS MOAT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
5 patent concepts (WIPO PROOF Jan 2026):
• Modular power architecture
• Robotic swap mechanism
• Fleet logistics integration
• Distributed sparing system
• Dual-robot coordination

Hardware + robotics + patents = compounding defensibility

THE ASK
━━━━━━━
$2M seed
Demo available. 40 seconds. Real hardware.
Show, don't tell.
```

## X/Twitter Strategy

### Wolfe je VRLO aktivan na X - ovo je primary channel:

```
APPROACH:
━━━━━━━━
1. Follow and engage genuinely with his content
2. Post contrarian takes on EV infrastructure
3. Use his language ("directional arrow", "narrative violation")
4. Demo video that's visually compelling

---

TWEET DRAFTS:

Tweet 1 (Contrarian thesis):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
The mainstream narrative in EV charging:
"It's a software problem"

Everyone's building dashboards for broken chargers.
Optimizing routes around failures.
Software layers on hardware problems.

Contrarian thesis: You can't software your way out of
broken atoms. Time to fix the hardware.

Tweet 2 (Directional arrow):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
Directional arrow in EV infrastructure:

Fleet electrification → inevitable
Higher reliability requirements → inevitable
Robotic maintenance → inevitable
Modular architecture → inevitable

We're building the intersection.
Self-healing chargers. Robot swaps failed modules in 40 sec.

---

Tweet 3 (Show don't tell):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
[VIDEO: Robot swapping module in 40 seconds]

Science fiction → Science fact

Self-healing EV charging infrastructure.
No technicians. No truck rolls. No downtime.

@wolfejosh you'd appreciate the atoms-based approach

## "Lux List" Newsletter Angle

### Wolfe sends weekly newsletter - reference it:

```
"Josh, your recent Lux List on [relevant topic] resonated.
The point about [specific insight] applies directly to
what we're building..."
```

---

## Fit Assessment

```
PROS:
✓ Deep tech is exactly their thesis
✓ Contrarian angle fits their style
✓ Hardware + robotics = "atoms not bits"
✓ Wolfe very accessible on X
✓ They like rebellious founders

CONS:
- Competitive deal flow
- May want more technical progress
- US-centric portfolio (EU = harder)

VERDICT: HIGH PRIORITY
Excellent fit for contrarian/deep tech story.
Twitter engagement is the path in.
