## Combination Strategy

### LACI + Other Programs
| Program | Role | Timing |
|---------|------|--------|
| **HAX** | Hardware development, prototype | Apply now (rolling) |
| **Elemental** | Deployment capital ($1-3M) | Apply now (rolling) |
| **LACI** | US West Coast base, pilots, municipal access | Fall 2026 (Cohort 13) |

### Updated Strategy (Post Jan 16 Deadline)
Since Cohort 12 deadline passed:
1. **Apply to HAX/Elemental now** - Both have rolling applications
2. **Contact LACI Pipeline team** - Express interest for Cohort 13
3. **Build TEP connections** - Network with member companies independently
4. **Prepare for Fall 2026** - Use time to strengthen application

### Why LACI Still Important
1. **Pilot access** - Real deployment opportunities
2. **Municipal connections** - Hard to get elsewhere
3. **US market entry** - California = largest EV market
4. **2028 momentum** - Olympics creates urgency
5. **Low equity** - 1.5-3% warrant is founder-friendly

### Recommended Sequencing (Revised)
1. **HAX/Elemental** → Apply now, build prototype, initial traction
2. **LACI Cohort 13** → Fall 2026 application with stronger position
3. **Scale** → Use combined resources for deployment
