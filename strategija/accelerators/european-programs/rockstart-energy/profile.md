## Application Strategy

### Positioning for Rockstart

```
PROBLEM:   European bus fleets need charging infrastructure
           that's affordable, reliable, and locally serviceable

SOLUTION:  EK3 modular architecture (3.3 kW → 3 MW)
           + ROJ distributed intelligence
           + Fleet-based logistics (zero truck rolls)

WHY NOW:   EU 2030 mandates + AFIR funding
           + Serbia EXPO 2027 as beachhead

WHY US:    22 years hardware+software experience
           + Working prototype (Renode/Docker demo)
           + Patent-pending architecture
```

### Rockstart-Specific Angles

1. **Amsterdam as EU Base**
   - Netherlands = EV charging leader
   - Gateway to German, French markets
   - Strong public transport investment

2. **Co-Investment Opportunity**
   - EIT InnoEnergy alignment
   - European Investment Bank potential
   - National innovation funds

3. **150-180 Day Timeline**
   - Prototype refinement
   - First EU customer conversations
   - Certification roadmap
