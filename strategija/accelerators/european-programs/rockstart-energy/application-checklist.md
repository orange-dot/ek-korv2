## Key Messages for Application

### One-Liner
"EK3: Modular EV charging infrastructure for European bus fleet electrification"

### Problem Statement (EU Focus)
"Europe's 2030 zero-emission bus mandates require €280B in charging infrastructure. Current solutions are monolithic, expensive, and create vendor lock-in. Our customer in Serbia invested €1M in chargers that sit idle because proprietary firmware can't be adapted locally."

### Solution Summary
"EK3 is an extremely modular charging architecture: 3.3 kW building blocks that scale from 150 kW depot chargers to 3 MW MCS truck charging. Each module has distributed intelligence (ROJ swarm) - no central controller, no single point of failure. V2G-ready from day one."

### 4 D's Alignment

| D | How EK3 Aligns |
|---|----------------|
| **Decentralization** | ROJ swarm - no central controller, peer-to-peer coordination |
| **Decarbonization** | Enables bus fleet electrification, reduces transport emissions |
| **Digitalization** | Smart charging, V2G, predictive maintenance, fleet integration |
| **Transport** | Core focus - EV charging for commercial fleets |

### Why Rockstart
"Rockstart Energy's transport electrification focus aligns perfectly with EK3. We need EU market access, energy industry connections, and investor network for expansion from Serbia to Netherlands, Germany, and broader EU."
