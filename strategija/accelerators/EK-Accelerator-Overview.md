# Elektrokombinacija (EK) - Accelerator Strategy Overview

## What We're Building

**EK3** - A 3.3 kW modular EV charging module that scales from e-bikes to megawatt charging stations.

| Application | Modules | Power |
|-------------|---------|-------|
| E-bike | 1 | 3.3 kW |
| Home charger | 7 | 23 kW |
| DC Fast | 46 | 152 kW |
| Bus depot | 152 | 502 kW |
| MCS truck | 909 | 3 MW |

**One module design. Millions of units. 35% lower cost.**

## The Problem We Solve

A Serbian bus fleet operator spent **€1 million** on 10 ABB chargers. They tried to adapt them locally - hardware worked, but proprietary firmware meant the chargers sat idle for months. Multiple programming teams failed.

**€1M invested. Zero kWh delivered.**

This revealed the core problems:
- Monolithic designs can't be repaired locally
- Proprietary firmware = vendor lock-in
- €100k/unit is too expensive for emerging markets
- One component fails = entire charger down

---

## Our Solution

| Problem | EK3 Solution |
|---------|--------------|
| Monolithic design | 3.3 kW modules (extreme modularity) |
| Can't repair locally | Design for depot repair |
| Firmware lock-in | Open architecture (JEZGRO) |
| Single point of failure | Distributed intelligence (ROJ swarm) |
| High cost | Single SKU mass production |

**Key innovations:**
1. **ROJ Swarm** - No central controller, modules coordinate peer-to-peer
2. **Fleet Logistics** - Buses carry defective modules to depot (zero truck rolls)
3. **Circularity** - 15-25 year module lifecycle through repair/refurbishment

## Team

| Role | Responsibilities |
|------|------------------|
| **CEO** | Strategy, business development, marketing, legal, IP, procurement |
| **CTO** | Hardware, firmware, software, product architecture (22 years experience) |

Both founders: **100% full-time committed**

## Accelerator Strategy

### Target Programs

| Program | Investment | Status | Why |
|---------|------------|--------|-----|
| **HAX** | Up to $550K | Ready to apply | #1 hardware accelerator, rolling admissions |
| **Elemental Impact** | Up to $3M | Ready to apply | Deployment capital, community focus |
| **LACI** | $50-500K | Fall 2026 | Municipal fleet access, LA Metro |

### Application Readiness (HAX)

| Requirement | Status |
|-------------|--------|
| Working prototype | ✅ Done (Renode/Docker emulation) |
| Customer validation | ✅ Done (Serbian operator case) |
| 2+ co-founders | ✅ Done (CEO + CTO, both full-time) |
| Climate tech narrative | ✅ Done (bus fleet electrification) |

**HAX has rolling admissions - we can apply anytime.**

## IP Status

| Asset | Status |
|-------|--------|
| **Priority date** | January 2, 2026 (Git verified) |
| **Invention disclosures** | 5 documented |
| **Patent strategy** | 3-patent family planned |

**Inventions:**
1. Modular architecture (extreme granularity)
2. Swap station design
3. Distributed sparing
4. Fleet logistics
5. Coordinated robots

---

## Market Opportunity

- **Global EV bus market**: $50+ billion by 2030
- **Serbia EXPO 2027**: Electric bus infrastructure buildout
- **LA 2028 Olympics**: 129,000 chargers target, bus fleet electrification

---

## Current Status

| Area | Progress |
|------|----------|
| **Module design** | Complete (3.3 kW EK3 spec) |
| **Firmware** | Working (Renode emulation) |
| **Documentation** | Comprehensive (patent, technical, strategy) |
| **Customer validation** | Done (Serbian operator) |
| **Team** | Ready (CEO + CTO) |
| **Applications** | Ready to submit |

---

## Next Steps

1. **Submit HAX application** - Rolling, can do now
2. **Submit Elemental application** - Rolling, can do now
3. **Prepare for LACI Fall 2026** - Build relationships
4. **Continue prototype development** - Hardware validation
