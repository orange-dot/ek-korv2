## The Problem

### Current State of EV Charging Infrastructure

```
THE FRAGMENTATION PROBLEM:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Every manufacturer builds proprietary systems:
• ABB: Terra series - closed ecosystem
• Siemens: Sicharge - proprietary protocols
• ChargePoint: Express - vendor lock-in
• BYD: Own charging systems for own buses

RESULT:
• No interoperability between vendors
• No economies of scale in software
• No community innovation
• High switching costs for operators
• Slow industry progress
```

### Why This Matters for Electric Bus Fleets

| Challenge | Impact |
|-----------|--------|
| Mixed fleets | Operators run multiple bus brands → multiple charging systems |
| Depot constraints | Limited grid capacity must be shared intelligently |
| V2G potential | Buses could provide grid services, but no standard coordination |
| Maintenance | Each vendor = separate service contract, parts, training |
| Future-proofing | Locked into vendor roadmap, no flexibility |

## Market Size

### Total Addressable Market (TAM)

```
GLOBAL EV CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE (2025-2035)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Public charging: $100B+ cumulative investment (IEA estimate)
Fleet/depot charging: $30B+ segment
Bus depot specifically: $8-12B (EU + emerging markets)

EU ALONE:
• AFIR mandate: 1 charging point per 60km highway by 2025
• €5.4B earmarked for charging infrastructure (REPowerEU)
• 100,000+ public chargers needed by 2030
```

### Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM)

| Segment | Size | Our Focus |
|---------|------|-----------|
| EU bus depot charging | €3-5B | PRIMARY |
| EU logistics/truck depots | €2-3B | SECONDARY |
| Emerging markets (Balkans, etc.) | €1-2B | EXPANSION |

### Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM)

**5-Year Target:** €50-100M revenue
- 50-100 depot installations
- Average €500K-1M per depot (hardware + services)

## EU Policy Alignment

### Regulatory Tailwinds

| Regulation | Requirement | Our Alignment |
|------------|-------------|---------------|
| AFIR (Alternative Fuels Infrastructure) | Interoperability mandates | Open protocols, standard interfaces |
| Clean Vehicles Directive | Public fleet electrification | Bus depot infrastructure |
| REPowerEU | Accelerated renewable deployment | V2G capabilities |
| Fit for 55 | 55% emissions reduction by 2030 | Fleet optimization reduces energy use |

### EU Strategic Priorities

```
EU PRIORITIES WE ADDRESS:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. DIGITAL SOVEREIGNTY
   • Open-source European alternative to US/Chinese proprietary systems
   • Reduces dependency on foreign technology vendors

2. GREEN TRANSITION
   • Enables faster EV fleet adoption
   • V2G for grid flexibility
   • Optimized charging reduces peak demand

3. INDUSTRIAL COMPETITIVENESS
   • European standard for global export
   • Platform for EU hardware manufacturers
   • Ecosystem job creation

4. STRATEGIC AUTONOMY
   • Critical infrastructure with European control
   • Open standard prevents single-vendor lock-in
```

## Impact Metrics

### Environmental Impact

| Metric | Calculation | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Fleet efficiency | 10-15% energy reduction via optimization | CO2 reduction |
| V2G grid services | 50kWh per bus × 1000 buses = 50MWh flexibility | Grid stability |
| Faster EV adoption | Remove infrastructure barriers | Accelerated transition |

### Economic Impact

| Metric | Calculation | Impact |
|--------|-------------|--------|
| Infrastructure cost reduction | 20-30% via modularity + open source | Lower TCO |
| Vendor competition | Open platform = more suppliers | Price pressure |
| EU jobs | Hardware manufacturing, services | Economic growth |

### Social Impact

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| Public transport quality | Reliable electric bus operations |
| Air quality | Reduced urban emissions |
| Energy democracy | Distributed, resilient infrastructure |

## Competition Analysis

### Current Landscape

| Competitor | Approach | Weakness |
|------------|----------|----------|
| ABB | Proprietary Terra series | Vendor lock-in, high cost |
| Siemens | Sicharge ecosystem | Limited flexibility |
| ChargePoint | Network-centric model | US-focused, subscription fees |
| BYD | Vertical integration | Only for BYD vehicles |
| Heliox | Bus charging specialist | Proprietary, acquired by ABB |

### Why They Won't Open Source

```
INNOVATOR'S DILEMMA:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Incumbent business model:
├── Hardware margin: 30-40%
├── Software licensing: per-unit fees
├── Service contracts: recurring revenue
└── Parts/maintenance: captive market

OPEN SOURCE THREAT:
├── Eliminates software licensing
├── Commoditizes hardware
├── Enables third-party service
└── Reduces switching costs

RESULT: Incumbents structurally cannot go open source
        It would cannibalize existing revenue streams
```

### Our Advantage

| Factor | Incumbents | Elektrokombinacija |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Legacy revenue | Must protect | None (greenfield) |
| Technical debt | Decades of proprietary code | Clean architecture |
| Community | Not possible | Core strategy |
| Speed | Corporate bureaucracy | Startup agility |
| EU alignment | American/Chinese companies | European company |
