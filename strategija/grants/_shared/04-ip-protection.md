## Intellectual Property Strategy

### Layered Protection Approach

```
IP PROTECTION LAYERS:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

LAYER 1: PRIOR ART / PRIORITY (Defensive)
├── Bernstein blockchain timestamps (January 2026)
├── GPG-signed Git commits (public record)
├── Publication of technical documentation
└── Effect: Prevents others from patenting our innovations

LAYER 2: PATENTS (Offensive, Hardware)
├── EK3 module mechanical design
├── Thermal management innovations
├── Connector/interface mechanisms
└── Strategy: Patent hardware, open-source software

LAYER 3: OPEN SOURCE (Community Moat)
├── EK-KOR2 RTOS under MIT License
├── Reference implementations
├── Community contributions
└── Effect: Standard creation = defensible position

LAYER 4: TRADE SECRETS (Execution)
├── Manufacturing know-how
├── Certification processes
├── Customer relationships
└── Effect: Not easily replicable even with open source
```

## Patent Filing Strategy

### Planned Patent Family (3 Patents)

| Patent | Scope | Timeline | Budget |
|--------|-------|----------|--------|
| A: Umbrella | Modular power architecture | 2026 | €15-20K |
| B: Dual-Robot | Swap station mechanics | 2026-2027 | €15-20K |
| C: Fleet Logistics | Coordination algorithms | 2027 | €15-20K |

### Why This Split?

```
STRATEGIC RATIONALE:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

HARDWARE PATENTS (File):
• Mechanical designs are expensive to work around
• Clear infringement detection
• Supports hardware revenue model

SOFTWARE (Open Source, Don't Patent):
• Software patents costly and hard to enforce
• Open source creates community moat
• Prior art blocks competitors anyway
• MIT license enables ecosystem growth
```

---

## Open Source Licensing

### EK-KOR2 RTOS: MIT License (Planned)

```
MIT LICENSE CHOICE RATIONALE:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

PERMISSIVE:
• Maximum adoption potential
• No copyleft barriers for commercial users
• Enables proprietary derivatives (more ecosystem)

ALTERNATIVES CONSIDERED:
• GPL: Too restrictive for embedded industry
• Apache 2.0: Good, but MIT simpler
• LGPL: Complex for static linking

RESULT: MIT balances adoption vs protection
```

### What's Open vs. Proprietary

| Component | License | Rationale |
|-----------|---------|-----------|
| EK-KOR2 core | MIT | Maximum adoption |
| Scheduling algorithms | MIT | Standard creation |
| Consensus protocols | MIT | Interoperability |
| Reference hardware | CERN OHL | Hardware community |
| Certified modules | Proprietary | Revenue source |
| Fleet platform | Proprietary | Services revenue |

---

## Freedom to Operate

### Prior Art Search Conducted

| Area | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| Potential field scheduling | Clear | Novel application to temporal scheduling |
| Distributed consensus | Clear | Novel k=7 topological approach |
| Modular power electronics | Partial overlap | Focus on differentiated features |
| V2G coordination | Clear | Novel distributed approach |

### Risk Assessment

| Risk | Probability | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|------------|
| Patent troll | Low | Prior art, defensive publication |
| Competitor patent | Medium | Design-around, licensing |
| Open source contribution IP | Low | CLA (Contributor License Agreement) |

## Why We Can Share Everything

```
SHARING CALCULATION:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

RISK OF SHARING:
• Competitor sees code? → IP is timestamped, we have priority
• Someone forks? → That's the plan (OSS strategy)
• Copied before funding? → Can't copy the team or momentum

BENEFIT OF SHARING:
• Technical due diligence → Faster decisions
• Demonstrates confidence → Shows code is real
• Partnership mindset → Cultural fit signal
• No "pitch deck bravado" → What you see is what exists

CALCULATION:
Risk ≈ 0 (IP protected)
Benefit = HIGH (speed, trust, differentiation)

→ SHARE EVERYTHING
```

## Verification

### How to Verify Our Claims

```bash
# Clone repository (access on request)
git clone git@github.com:elektrokombinacija/autobusi-punjaci.git
cd autobusi-punjaci

# Verify priority date (GPG signed commit)
git log --show-signature -1 dd14f6f63aa97a7985efbaad55a5372d9ad3e1fc

# Expected output:
# commit dd14f6f63aa97a7985efbaad55a5372d9ad3e1fc
# gpg: Good signature from "Bojan Janjatovic"
# Date: Thu Jan 2 23:40:54 2026 +0100

# Bernstein verification via their portal with Project ID
```
