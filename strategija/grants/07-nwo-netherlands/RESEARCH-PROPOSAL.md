# NWO Netherlands - Research Proposal Skeleton

**Program:** NWO Open Competition / TTW (Applied Sciences)
**Type:** Academic-Industry Partnership
**Role:** Industry Partner (Elektrokombinacija)
**Amount:** €300-500K (to academic partner)
**Duration:** 4 years (PhD project)

---

## 1. Project Title

**Distributed Coordination for Scalable Power Electronics: From Potential Fields to Industrial Practice**

---

## 2. Research Context

### Problem Statement

Modern power electronics systems increasingly consist of multiple coordinating modules. Current approaches rely on centralized controllers that represent single points of failure and scalability bottlenecks. This research investigates distributed coordination mechanisms that enable self-organizing behavior without central control.

### Scientific Questions

1. **Theoretical:** What are the convergence guarantees for potential field-based scheduling in temporal domains?

2. **Algorithmic:** How can Byzantine fault tolerance be achieved with purely local information exchange?

3. **Practical:** What are the real-world performance limits for distributed coordination in power electronics?

---

## 3. Research Approach

### Phase 1: Mathematical Foundations (Year 1)

- Formal specification of temporal potential field model
- Stability analysis using Lyapunov methods
- Complexity bounds for convergence

### Phase 2: Algorithm Development (Year 2)

- Implementation of coordination protocols
- Integration with consensus mechanisms
- Property-based testing framework

### Phase 3: Experimental Validation (Year 3)

- Embedded system implementation
- Hardware testbed construction
- Performance benchmarking

### Phase 4: Generalization (Year 4)

- Extension to other CPS domains
- Thesis writing
- Technology transfer to industry partner
