# Research Grant Strategy - Master Plan

**Prepared:** January 2026
**Company:** Elektrokombinacija
**Founders:** Marija Janjatovic (CEO) & Bojan Janjatovic (CTO)

## Strategic Rationale

### Why Research Grants Before VC?

```
CURRENT STATUS:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
✓ Working technology (EK-KOR2 RTOS, 22 tests passing)
✓ Novel algorithms (potential field scheduling, MAPF-HET)
✓ Hardware design complete (EK3 3.3kW module)
✓ IP protected (Bernstein blockchain, Jan 2026)
✓ Industry validation (Infineon engagement)

✗ No paying customers
✗ No pilot deployments
✗ No team beyond founders
✗ No European network
✗ No power electronics hire

CONCLUSION: Research grant profile, not VC profile (yet)
```

### Grant vs VC Comparison

| Aspect | Research Grant | VC Seed |
|--------|----------------|---------|
| What they value | Novel technology | Market traction |
| Revenue required | No | Ideally yes |
| Dilution | 0% | 15-25% |
| Decision time | 3-9 months | 2-8 weeks |
| Success rate | 5-20% | 1-5% |
| Side benefits | Partners, credibility | Network, speed |
| Best for stage | Pre-revenue R&D | Post-validation growth |

## Grant Portfolio Strategy

### Target Programs (Priority Order)

| # | Program | Amount | Timeline | Probability | Priority |
|---|---------|--------|----------|-------------|----------|
| 1 | Innovation Fund Serbia - PoC | €100K | Q1 2026 | 30% | HIGH |
| 2 | WBSO (NL Tax Credit) | €50-100K/yr | Q1 2026 | 80% | HIGH |
| 3 | MIT Haalbaarheid (NL) | €20K | Q2 2026 | 40% | MEDIUM |
| 4 | EIC Accelerator | €2.5M | Q2 2026 | 8% | HIGH |
| 5 | Horizon Europe Cluster 5 | €2-5M | Q3 2026 | 15% | MEDIUM |
| 6 | EIC Pathfinder | €3-4M | Q4 2026 | 12% | BACKUP |
| 7 | NWO (via academic partner) | €300-500K | Q4 2026 | 20% | MEDIUM |

### Expected Value Calculation

```
PORTFOLIO EXPECTED VALUE:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Innovation Fund:    €100K × 30% = €30K
WBSO:               €75K × 80%  = €60K
MIT Haalbaarheid:   €20K × 40%  = €8K
EIC Accelerator:    €2.5M × 8%  = €200K
Horizon Europe:     €3M × 15%   = €450K
EIC Pathfinder:     €3M × 12%   = €360K
NWO:                €400K × 20% = €80K
─────────────────────────────────────────
EXPECTED VALUE:                   €1.19M

REALISTIC SCENARIO (win 2-3 grants): €150K - €2.7M
```
