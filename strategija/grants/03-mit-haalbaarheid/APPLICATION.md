# MIT Haalbaarheid - Feasibility Study Application

**Program:** MIT-regeling (Mkb-innovatiestimulering Topsectoren)
**Sub-program:** Haalbaarheidsstudie (Feasibility Study)
**Agency:** RVO
**Amount:** €20,000 (max)
**Duration:** 12 months

## 1. Project Summary

### Title
**Market Feasibility Study: Open-Source Coordination Platform for EU Electric Bus Fleet Charging Infrastructure**

### Abstract

This feasibility study will validate the commercial potential of EK-KOR2, an open-source Real-Time Operating System for coordinating electric vehicle charging infrastructure. While the technical prototype exists, market validation is needed to:

1. Confirm demand among EU transit operators
2. Identify optimal go-to-market strategy
3. Validate pricing and business model
4. Assess certification requirements

The study will include interviews with 10+ potential customers, competitive analysis, and business model refinement.

## 2. Innovation Description

### What We've Built

**EK-KOR2 RTOS:**
- Novel potential field scheduling algorithm
- Distributed consensus without central coordinator
- Lock-free IPC with <100ns latency
- Working C implementation (22 tests passing)

**EK3 Power Module Design:**
- 3.3kW modular power electronics
- 900V SiC MOSFETs
- Complete design ready for prototype

### Technical Readiness

| Component | TRL |

| EK-KOR2 RTOS | 4 (lab validated) |
| EK3 design | 3 (proof of concept) |

### What We Need to Validate

| Question | Method |
|----------|--------|
| Will transit operators adopt open-source? | Customer interviews |
| What features are must-have vs nice-to-have? | Requirements gathering |
| What price point is acceptable? | Willingness-to-pay research |
| What certification is required? | Regulatory analysis |
| Who are the early adopter profiles? | Market segmentation |
