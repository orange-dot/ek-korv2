### Template A: Academic Partner Initial Contact

```
Subject: Horizon Europe Collaboration - Open-Source EV Charging Coordination

Dear Professor [Name],

I am Bojan Janjatovic, CTO of Elektrokombinacija, a Netherlands-based startup
developing open-source coordination systems for electric vehicle charging
infrastructure.

We are preparing a Horizon Europe proposal (Cluster 5, D5) and believe
[University/Group] would be an excellent research partner based on your work
in [specific area].

Our project, OPENCHARGE, aims to develop and validate an open-source RTOS
for distributed charging infrastructure. Key technical innovations include:

- Potential field scheduling for emergent coordination
- MAPF-HET algorithms for heterogeneous fleet management (7,060 LoC validated)
- Current TRL 5 with 27 validated test vectors

We have industry validation from Infineon Technologies and are targeting
pilot deployments with EU transit operators.

For [University], we see opportunities in:
- [Specific research area 1]
- [Specific research area 2]
- Publication opportunities in [relevant venues]

Would you be available for a 30-minute call in the coming weeks to discuss
potential collaboration?

Best regards,
Bojan Janjatovic
CTO, Elektrokombinacija B.V.
```

### Template B: Industry Partner Initial Contact

```
Subject: Horizon Europe Partnership - EV Charging Infrastructure

Dear [Name],

I am reaching out regarding a potential Horizon Europe collaboration in
distributed EV charging infrastructure.

Elektrokombinacija is developing EK-KOR2, an open-source RTOS for coordinating
modular charging systems. We have achieved TRL 5 validation and are preparing
a Horizon Europe Cluster 5 proposal.

[For Infineon specifically: Building on our existing emulator collaboration,
we see an opportunity to deepen our partnership...]

For [Company], we see mutual value in:
- Technology validation with real-world applications
- Market positioning in the growing EV infrastructure sector
- EU funding to de-risk joint development
- Access to transit operator pilot sites

The project budget is approximately €4M over 36-48 months, with industry
partner shares typically €600-800K.

Would you be interested in exploring this opportunity? I would welcome a
call to discuss how [Company] could benefit from and contribute to the
consortium.

Best regards,
Bojan Janjatovic
CTO, Elektrokombinacija B.V.
```

### Template C: Pilot Operator Initial Contact

```
Subject: EV Fleet Charging Pilot Opportunity - Horizon Europe Project

Dear [Name],

I am contacting you regarding an opportunity to participate in a Horizon
Europe project focused on next-generation EV charging infrastructure.

Elektrokombinacija is developing open-source coordination technology for
electric bus depot charging. Our technology enables:

- Interoperability between different charging equipment vendors
- Intelligent load balancing and grid integration
- V2G (vehicle-to-grid) capabilities
- Significant cost reduction through modularity

We are seeking pilot sites for validation, and [Operator] would be an ideal
partner given your [fleet size/sustainability goals/location].

As a pilot partner, [Operator] would receive:
- Early access to next-generation charging technology
- EU co-funding for infrastructure development
- Technical support throughout the project
- Input into technology development priorities

The pilot commitment would involve hosting charging infrastructure at a
depot for 18-24 months during the project validation phase.

Would you be interested in learning more? I would welcome a call to discuss
how this could benefit [Operator]'s electrification roadmap.

Best regards,
Bojan Janjatovic
CTO, Elektrokombinacija B.V.
