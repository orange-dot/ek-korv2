CODE SAMPLES
============

Representative code snippets from personal hobby project.

Files:
------
01-test-vector-example.json  - Shared test vector format (C & Rust must match)
02-go-error-handling.go      - Go explicit error handling pattern
03-rust-state-machine.rs     - Rust exhaustive pattern matching
04-c-consensus-types.c       - C data structures for distributed consensus
05-dockerfile-go.dockerfile  - Minimal Go container (10 MB vs 400 MB)

Key Points:
-----------
- JSON test vectors are human-written ground truth
- Both C and Rust must produce identical output for identical input
- Go demonstrates "no magic" programming style
- Rust compiler enforces handling all cases
- Docker shows deployment simplicity benefit
